Unfortunately, the wiki (formerly under http://wiki.okfn.org/Working_Groups/linguistics) seems to be gone already. This contained all minutes of past meetings.

A few notes on OWLG history (otherwise undocumented)
-
- *Foundation*: The Open Linguistics Working Group (OWLG) was founded as a Working Group of the Open Knowledge Foundation (now Open Knowledge International) in 2010. We had a kickoff face-to-face meeting in Berlin, Germany, October 2010, then more or less regular calls at (roughly) every 6-8 weeks. 
- *Goals*: We immediately identified goals and topics, including the plan to collect relevant open language resources. At the time, the OWLG had a focus on open data, not (yet) on linked open data. When the scope became more narrowly focused on Linked Open Data, this didn't express a change of goals, merely one particular topic that a lot of people were particularly interested in. The original goals have thus never been reformulated and are still being pursued, but we're most active in (Linguistic) Linked Open Data.
- *LLOD Cloud*: The collection of language resources was an original goal and initially conducted via a shared document. Since December 2010, we developed the vision of Linked Open Data cloud of linguistic resorces (what would later become the Linguistic Linked Open Data [LLOD] cloud diagram). In some presentations, the December 2010 version of the diagram was acclaimed to be a "sketch on a table napkin", but we have no record of the original draft. We do have a diagram draft from January 2011 (http://linguistic-lod.org/llod-cloud-jan2011) created by Sebastian Hellmann and Christian Chiarcos (http://linguistic-lod.org/llod-cloud-jan2011). The LDL book (2012) contained an LLOD cloud draft that was based on hypothetical links between respective chapters/contributions. The first actual LLOD cloud diagram (with real resources behind) was created at the 1st Workshop on Multilingual Linked Open Data for Enterprises (MLODE-2012, Leipzig, Germany, Sep 2012). The diagram was originally hosted at the OWLG website, but subsequently moved to a separate domain (http://linguistic-lod.org/). In 2014, "linguistics" was recognized as a top-level category of the LOD cloud diagram, since 2019, it is mirrored as a sub-cloud diagram of the LOD cloud diagram (https://lod-cloud.net/#linguistic).
- *OKCon 2011*: First public appearance with a linguistics track at the 6th Open Knowledge Conference (OKCon 2011), Berlin, Germany, June 30 & July 1, 2011 (http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-739/).
- *Linked Data in Linguistics (LDL)*: International workshops organized by the OWLG since 2012, annually (2012-2016), since 2017 alternating with the newly created Language, Data and Knowledge (LDK) conference series. These workshops are collocated with broader conferences in linguistics or language technology (DGfS, ACL, LREC), but especially with Language Resource and Evaluation Conferences (LREC). At LREC 2012, we invited people to an informal linked data meeting in a coffeebreak, with eventually more than 50 participants, and given the interest, we have been doing LDL workshops at every LREC since 2014.
- *LDL Book and Proceedings*: Together with a number of position papers by their editors, the proceedings of LDL 2012 were published by Springer in May 2012 (Chiarcos, Nordhoff, Hellmann (eds., 2012), Linked Data in Linguistics. Representing and Connecting Language Data and Language Metadata. Springer. Heidelberg, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-28249-2, https://www.springer.com/de/book/9783642282485). In parallel, the author versions of the papers were published online and hosted in Leipzig (this website is gone now). Subsequent proceedings were published together with the main conference, they can be either found on the ACL Anthology (https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/) or the LREC websites (https://lrec-conf.org). Note that most of them contain an extended preface that summarizes the history and progress of the OWLG until then. The LDL-2012 book remained the reference publication for Linguistic Linked Open Data until January 2020, when the first monograph on the topic appeared. 
- *Hackathons/datathons*: OWLG participants organized a number of hackathons (resp., datathons), e.g., at workshops on Multilingual Linked Open Data for Enterprises (MLODE-2012, Leipzig, Sep. 2012; MLODE-2014, Leipzig, Sep. 2014). At MLODE 2012, the LLOD cloud (and a diagram) was initially created, replacing the earlier drafts that contained linkable (rather than linked) resources. Since 2015, OWLG participants organized biannual Summer Datathon on Linguistic Linked Open Data (SD-LLOD 2015, Madrid, Spain; SD-LLOD 2017, Madrid, Spain; SD-LLOD 2019, Schloss Dagstuhl, Germany) as a summer school. Other summer schools on linguistic linked open data include EUROLAN-2015 and sessions of ESSLI since 2015.
- *Monograph*: Since LDL-2012, various OWLG participants had plans for creating a monograph as a reference for Linked Data in Linguistics. This finally appeared with Cimiano, Chiarcos, Gracia and McCrae (2020), Linguistic Linked Data, Springer, Cham, January 2020.
- *Migration*: In late 2019, it was announced to the list moderators that the OKF would no longer support mailing lists. This is partially due to European legislation (concerns about GDPR). By the end of January 2020, we migrate to a new mailing list provider. Part of this process is to create this repository as a backup for OKF-hosted information.
