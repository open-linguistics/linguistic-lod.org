<PRE> 4th Workshop on Linked Data in Linguistics (LDL-2015): Resources and
Applications
=================================================================================

collocated with ACL-IJCNLP 2015, Beijing, July 31st, 2015,
<A HREF="http://ldl2015.linguistic-lod.org">http://ldl2015.linguistic-lod.org</A>

*Deadline extended to Thursday 14th May*

The substantial growth in the quantity, diversity and complexity of
linguistic data accessible on the Web has led to many new and interesting
research areas in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and linguistics.
However, resource interoperability represents a major challenge that still
needs to be addressed, in particular if information from different sources
is combined. With its fourth instantiation, the Linked Data in Linguistics
workshop continues to provide a major forum to discuss the creation of
linguistic resources on the web using linked data principles, as well as
issues of interoperability, distribution protocols, access and integration
of language resources and natural language processing pipelines developed
on this basis.

As a result of the preceding workshops, a considerable number of resources
is now available in the Linguistic Linked Open Data (LLOD) cloud. LDL-2015
will thus specifically welcome papers addressing the usage aspect of Linked
Data and related technologies in NLP, linguistics and neighboring fields,
such as Digital Humanities.

Organized by the interdisciplinary Open Linguistics Working Group, the LDL
workshop series is open to researchers from a wide range of disciplines,
including (computational) linguistics and NLP, but also the Semantic Web,
linguistic typology, corpus linguistics, terminology and lexicography. In
2015, we plan to increase the involvement of the LIDER project and the
LD4LT community group, to build on their efforts to facilitate the use of
linked data and language resources for commercial applications, and to
continue the success of LIDER&#8216;s roadmapping workshop series in engagement
with enterprise.

Topics of Interest
==================

We invite presentations of algorithms, methodologies, experiments, use
cases, project proposals and position papers regarding the creation,
publication or application of linguistic data collections and their linking
with other resources, as well as descriptions of such data. This includes,
but is not limited to, the following:

Resources:
----------
- Modelling linguistic data and metadata with OWL and/or RDF.
- Ontologies for linguistic data and metadata collections as well as
cross-lingual retrieval.
- Descriptions of data sets following Linked Data principles.
- Legal and social aspects of Linguistic Linked Open Data.
- Best practices for the publication and linking of multilingual knowledge
resources.

Applications:
------------
- Applications of such data, other ontologies or linked data from any
subdiscipline of linguistics or NLP.
- The role of (Linguistic) Linked Open Data to address challenges of
multilinguality and interoperability.
- Application and applicability of (Linguistic) Linked Open Data for
knowledge extraction, machine translation and other NLP tasks.
- NLP contributions to (Linguistic) Linked Open Data.

We invite both long (8 pages and 2 pages of references, formatted according
to the ACL-IJCNLP guidelines) and short papers (4 pages and 2 pages of
references) representing original research, innovative approaches and
resource types, use cases or in-depth discussions. Short papers may also
represent project proposals, work in progress or data set descriptions.

Dataset Description Papers
==========================

In addition to full papers and regular short papers, authors may submit
short papers with a dataset descriptions describing a resource&#8217;s
availability, published location and key statistics (such as size). Such
papers do not need to show a novel method for the creation or publishing of
the data but instead will be judged on the quality, usefulness and clarity
of description given in the paper.

Important Dates
===============

Paper submission: May 14th, 2015
Notification of Acceptance: June 5th, 2015
Camera-Ready Copy: June 21st, 2015
Workshop: July 31st, 2015
Please submit papers via SoftConf at: <A HREF="https://www.softconf.com/acl2015/LDL/">https://www.softconf.com/acl2015/LDL/</A>
