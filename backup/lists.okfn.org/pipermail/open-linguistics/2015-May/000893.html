                   EUROLAN-2015

                          Summer School on 
             LINGUISTIC LINKED OPEN DATA
                 12th in the series of EUROLAN Schools
                         13 - 25 July 2015
                           Sibiu, Romania
                   <A HREF="http://eurolan.info.uaic.ro/2015/">http://eurolan.info.uaic.ro/2015/</A>
                
                **EARLY REGISTRATION ENDS JUNE 10 2015**

Linguistic Linked Open Data is a topic of emerging importance in the field of
natural language processing (NLP). Increasingly, researchers are rendering major
linguistic resources, including annotated corpora, lexicons, databases, and
ontologies, in a format to enable their exploitation in the Semantic Web.
Linking the contents of these resources to each other as well as to common
ontologies can enable access to and discovery of detailed linguistic
information, which would be otherwise impossible, and which could, in turn,
foster a major leap in NLP research and development.

At the same time, the movement toward open data is growing in the field of NLP.
For years, research has been constrained by limited access to corpora, lexicons,
and other language resources due to licensing requirements. Researchers and data
holders alike are now seeking ways to provide open access to these data in order
to promote unfettered use, reuse, and enhancement of common datasets throughout
the field.

EUROLAN 2015 will provide a comprehensive overview of Linguistic Linked Open
Data, including introduction to the formalisms for representing linguistic
resources using Semantic Web technologies such as the Resource Description
Format (RDF) and the Ontology Web Language (OWL), as well as means to extract
knowledge from language resources and exploit it using Semantic Web query
languages and reasoning capabilities.Specific topics treated in the school
include, but are not limited to:

&#8226; Introduction to the semantic web, linked data and knowledge graphs
&#8226; Extracting and integrating knowledge on the web from text, semi-structured 
  and structured data
&#8226; Ontologies and reasoning
&#8226; Query systems using SPARQL
&#8226; Design of domain specific query languages
&#8226; Linguistic annotations as linked data
&#8226; Annotation interoperability
&#8226; Taxonomy extraction
&#8226; BabelNet as linked data
&#8226; Lexicographic linked data
