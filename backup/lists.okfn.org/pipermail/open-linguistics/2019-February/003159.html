<PRE>Call for Workshop Proposals

Fourteenth International Conference on Digital Information Management 
(ICDIM 2019)
August 22-24, 2019
Irish Computer Society, Dublin, Ireland
(Technically co-sponosored by IEEE Technology Engineering Management 
Society)
icdim.org
(Proceedings and workshop papers will be published by IEEE TMC and 
indexed in IEEE Xplore and dblp)

The Conference Committee invites proposals from prospective researchers 
to organize one day workshops during the ICDIM 2019.

The main goal of the ICDIM 2019 workshops is to stimulate and facilitate 
active exchange, interaction and comparison of approaches, methods and 
ideas related to specific topics, both theoretical and applied, in the 
general areas related to digital information management. The workshops 
will provide an optimum environment where participants will have the 
opportunity to discuss specific technical topics in an atmosphere that 
fosters the active exchange of ideas.

The workshop organizers will be responsible for notifying the workshop, 
forming the program committees, reviewing and selecting the papers, and 
ensure high quality of papers. All papers accepted for workshops will be 
included in the Workshop Proceedings.

The workshop organizers will also have the discretion of editing 
selected papers (after their expansion and revision) into books or 
special journal issues. Workshops may be full-day or half-day. A 
full-day workshop should select 12-15 regular papers, while a half-day 
workshop should select 6-8 regular papers, from a large number of 
submissions.

Workshop Proposal Submission Details
ICDIM 2019 workshop proposals should include the following elements:
Title of the workshop.
The organizers name, affiliation, mailing address and e-mail address .
A description of the topic of the workshop (not exceeding 250 words).
Type of the workshop (full-day or half-day).
A description of how the workshop will contribute to the field of 
Digital Information and Web Technologies.
A short description on how the workshop will be advertised so as to 
ensure a sufficiently wide range of authors and high quality papers.
Optionally, only for full-day workshops, the title of a proposed panel, 
with a brief description highlighting the reasons of interest of the 
issues to be debated.
After the acceptance of a workshop proposal the organizer(s) should:
Create a Call for papers/participation for the workshop.
Create a Web page for the workshop, the link of which will be published 
on the Conference Web site.
Create a Board of Reviewers (Program Committee).
Review and select papers.
Schedule the workshop activities.
Those papers selected by a workshop organizer will also be reviewed by 
the Workshop Co-Chairs for final acceptance.
All submitted papers will be reviewed on the basis of technical quality, 
relevance, significance, and clarity.
We will provide an online paper submission and review system to support 
the workshops.
