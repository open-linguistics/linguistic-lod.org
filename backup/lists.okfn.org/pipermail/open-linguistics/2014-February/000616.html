  Call for Participation SEMANTiCS 2014

Transfer // Engineering // Community

10th International Conference on Semantic Systems (formerly known as 
I-SEMANTICS)

Leipzig, Germany, September 4-5, 2014

<A HREF="http://www.semantics.cc">http://www.semantics.cc</A>

Towards Engineering of Information Machines - We believe that semantic 
technologies are mature enough to dare the jump from research to 
engineering. We would like to invite you to Leipzig, Germany to explore 
with us best practices in engineering semantic systems.

*Important Information (to help you prepare):*

  * The *deadline *for scientific papers will be *May 30th*a separate
    call for papers will be announced soon.
  * SEMANTiCS 2014 will be co-located with
      o September 3: 2nd DBpedia Community Meeting:
        <A HREF="http://wiki.dbpedia.org/meetings/Leipzig2014">http://wiki.dbpedia.org/meetings/Leipzig2014</A>
      o September 2: Multilingual Linked Open Data for Enterprises
        (MLODE 2014)
      o September 1-3: More workshops, meetings, tutorials
  * Workshop, Community Meetings and Challenges: We have a total of
    three days reserved for additional meetings, tutorials and workshops
    for September 1 - 3. If you are interested in a free room (coffee
    included), please send an email to the Chair of the Organising
    Committee, Ricardo Usbeck
    (<A HREF="http://www.semantics.cc/home/committee/organising-committee/">http://www.semantics.cc/home/committee/organising-committee/</A>).

The annual SEMANTiCS conference (formerly known as I-Semantics) is the 
meeting place for professionals who make semantic computing work and 
understand the benefits and discuss how to overcome its limitations. 
Every year, SEMANTiCS attracts information managers, IT-architects, 
software engineers, and researchers, from organisations ranging from 
NPOs, public administrations to the largest companies in the world. 
Attendees learn from industry experts and top researchers about emerging 
trends and topics in semantic software, enterprise data, linked data &amp; 
open data strategies and methodologies in knowledge modeling and text &amp; 
data analytics. The SEMANTiCS community is very diverse; attendees have 
responsibilities in a range of areas, including knowledge management, 
technical documentation, e-commerce, big data analytics, enterprise 
search, document management, business intelligence, and enterprise 
vocabulary management.

SEMANTiCS 2014 in Leipzig continues our long tradition of bringing 
together colleagues from around the world to present papers, panels, 
exhibitions and posters, to discuss best practices of semantic systems 
in birds-of-a-feather sessions and exchange knowledge further in 
informal settings. SEMANTiCS addresses problems common among information 
managers, software engineers, IT-architects and various specialist 
departments working to develop, implement and/or evaluate semantic 
software systems.

The SEMANTiCS program is a rich mix of technical talks, panel 
discussions of important topics, and presentations by people who are 
ambitious to make information machines work - just like you. In 
addition, attendees can network with experts in a variety of fields. 
These relationships provide great value to organisations as they 
encounter subtle technical issues. The expertise gained by SEMANTiCS 
attendees has a long-term impact on their careers and organisations. 
These factors make SEMANTiCS the premiere event for our community.  The 
following 'horizontals' (topics) and 'verticals' (industries) are mainly 
addressed:

  * Business Models, Governance &amp; Data Strategies
  * Knowledge Discovery &amp; Intelligent Search
  * Data Integration &amp; Enterprise Linked Data
  * Big Data &amp; Text Analytics
  * Data Portals &amp; Knowledge Visualisation
  * Document Management &amp; Content Management
  * Terminology, Thesaurus &amp; Ontology Management

  * Industry &amp; Engineering
  * Life Sciences &amp; Health Care
  * Public Administration
  * Galleries, Libraries, Archives &amp; Museums (GLAM)
  * Media, Publishing &amp; Advertising
  * Financial Industry
  * Telecommunications
  * Energy

We encourage participants to submit proposals for workshops, thematic 
focus and special programmes and events in contacting anyone from the 
SEMANTiCS Organising Committee: 
(<A HREF="http://www.semantics.cc/home/committee/organising-committee/">http://www.semantics.cc/home/committee/organising-committee/</A>)

Call for Industry Presentations and Research Papers as well Posters and 
Demos will be announced at www.semantics.cc &lt;<A HREF="http://www.semantics.cc">http://www.semantics.cc</A>&gt; soon.

Transfer: Research and experts meet industry, industry meets experts and 
research. SEMANTiCS is the place to exchange (project) ideas based on 
best practices and to learn more about the various perspectives one can 
have on probably the most valuable resources of our days: data &amp; 
information.

Engineering: Software providers, developers and IT-architects meet 
research and (potential) users from industry. SEMANTiCS is the place to 
dive deep into semantic web and linked data technologies.

Community: Make new friends and renew old acquaintances. SEMANTiCS is 
the meeting place to discuss and to initiate new projects, to extend 
ongoing activities, and to showcase the latest developments.

On behalf of all the people organizing SEMANTiCS 2014, we hope to see 
you in September in Leipzig,
Sebastian Hellmann (AKSW, DBpedia), Harald Sack 
(Hasso-Plattner-Institut), Agata Filipowska (Poznan University of 
Economics), Christian Dirschl (Wolters Kluwer) and Andreas Blumenauer 
(Semantic Web Company)
