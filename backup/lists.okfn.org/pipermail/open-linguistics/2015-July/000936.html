Call for Workshop Papers

First International Workshop on 'Internet of Everything'

In Conjunction with the Tenth International Conference on Digital  
Information Management (ICDIM 2015)
<A HREF="http://icdim.org/internet.html">http://icdim.org/internet.html</A>
Jeju Island, South Korea
October 21-23, 2015

Technically co-sponsored by the IEEE Technology Engineering Management Society
Accepted workshop papers will be published in the proceedings indexed  
by IEEE Xplore.



About the Workshop


The Internet of Everything (IoE) is expected to also make impacts in  
government, education, finance and transportation. On the consumer  
side there are nearly endless combinations of applications. The  
Internet of Things will forever change our personal and professional  
lives. By 2020, there will be 50 billion connected devices  
communicating through the Internet. Devices can range from connected  
coffee makers, cars, or sensors on cattle to connected machines in a  
production plant. These devices provide data that offers new insights,  
and as they talk to each other, they develop their own intelligence  
and can advise customers about optimal ways to put them to use. This  
will revolutionize consumer habits and the way we do work and services.

Realizing the potential of IoE the proposed workshop will address the  
new research and also visulaize the future IoT. The topics the  
workshop address includes but not limited to

The Internet of Things and Industry 4.0
Smart Services
Sensors
Smart Grid
Effects on Society
Challenges and Opportunities for Society
Business Perspective
Digital Transformation and Business
Smart Software for Smart Services
Enabling Technologies
Challenges and Opportunities for Business
IoT for Supply Chain Management
