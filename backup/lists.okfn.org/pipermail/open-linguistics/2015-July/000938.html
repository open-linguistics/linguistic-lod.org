*-- CALL FOR PAPERS: Future Search Engines 2015 **--**
**-**- Deadline for submissions: August 9th, 2015 -**-**
*

*2nd International Workshop on Big Data and Semantic Technologies in
Backend and Frontend **of *
*Future Search Engines (FoRESEE 2015) at SEMANTiCS 2015, Vienna, 15.09.2015*

The workshop on Future Search Engines aims at analyzing and integrating
vast amounts of data and semantic technologies in search engines. This
workshop will discuss state-of-the-art approaches and methodologies
regarding industrial as well as research search-driven applications and
technologies.


** Focus: Big Data and Search (Backend)****
Search Engines are prime examples of Big Data technology. In addition to
processing huge amounts of data, its storage, analysis and management
are central issues of Big Data. Various diverse crawling, mining,
linking and integration methods form the basis of every modern search
technology. Nowadays, search engines exceed classic keyword-based
document retrieval by leveraging semantic technologies such as question
answering, user context inception and conversational interaction.
Furthermore, semantic datasets such as the Linked Open Data Cloud are
freely available, supporting knowledge acquisition at scale. Intelligent
linking of knowledge to answer a specific search need by using
geo-spatial information, multimedia and social data is regarded as key
to the satisfaction of the user information need.

** Focus: Human-Semantic Interaction and Human-Computer Interaction
(Frontend)****
Visually well represented search results are an important factor for the
success of a search engine. Next to presenting large amount of data to
the user, we focus on the integration of semantic technologies in
Web-Interfaces. Traditional non-semantic search engines demand different
interfaces. Data from knowledge bases, such as the Google Knowledge
Graph, needs special representation. In particular, the semantic
component of the query needs to be explicitly depicted. Semantic
entities have to be conveyed in an adequate way by a smart interaction
design. Resulting user data generated inside the browser can be
intercepted and be further utilized to optimize the search interaction.
Client-side data comprises mouse cursor movement, page visits and clicks
on certain results. For instance, this data enables improving ranking
results iteratively. Additionally, the increasing vast amount of data
requires stream-based technologies to handle resulting information
efficiently.

Expected papers deal with innovative ideas, methods, models, techniques,
case studies and practical experiences. The aforementioned description
can be expanded by the following points:

** 1. Big Data and Semantic Search****
- Analysis of Linked Data and the Internet of Things
- Management and efficient storage
- Big Data analytics, e.g., Map-Reduce algorithms
- Recommender Systems
- Architectures and frameworks for Semantic Search using Big Data
- Search on non-relational storage solutions (NoSQL), e.g.,
triplestores, graph databases, full-text indexes, etc.
- Data cleansing, integration and Best Practices
- Combining Web technologies with Big Data and Semantic Web
- Social, semantic, explorative and multimedia search
- Query processing and result ranking
- (Industrial) use cases
*
*** 2. Human-Semantic Interaction and Human-Computer Interaction with
Search-driven Applications **
- Visual representation of Linked and Big Data
- Interfaces for representing natural language queries
- Mobility and Semantic Search
- Cutting-Edge and rising technologies for search-driven HCI
- Best Practices for representing semantic data
- Integration of implicit and explicit user feedback
- (Industrial) use cases

This listing raises no claim of completeness. Contributions handling
topics other than the mentioned ones will be considered as well as if
they fit the context of the workshop.

** **Important Dates **
09.08.2015 - Paper submission deadline
18.08.2015 - Acceptance notification
01.09.2015 - Camera ready version
15.09.2015 - FoRESEE workshop

Submission can be made using
<A HREF="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=foresee2015.">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=foresee2015.</A> We encourage
for submitting research papers, position papers and work-in-progress
papers as well as experience reports.
