Call for Workshop Papers

Fourth Workshop on &#8220;Advanced Techniques on Data Analytics and Data  
Visualization&quot;

In Conjunction with the Tenth International Conference on Digital  
Information Management (ICDIM 2015)
<A HREF="http://www.icdim.org/workshop.php">http://www.icdim.org/workshop.php</A>
Jeju Island, South Korea
October 21-23, 2015

Technically co-sponsored by the IEEE Technology Management Council
Accepted workshop papers will be published in the proceedings indexed  
by IEEE Xplore.



About the Workshop


Data are growing at an exponential rate nowadays. In order to take  
advantage of them, it is important for businesses and organizations to  
be able to make sense out of them by determining the trends, patterns  
and underlying insights of the gathered data. Hence problems can be  
detected early before they result in actual damage. Some examples of  
data analytics cover tasks of finding suspicious records in accounts  
payable, evaluating activities of business processes, modeling  
customers&#8217; behavioral patterns and deriving the best strategies in  
business decision etc. Such complex tasks go beyond simple statistics.  
Advanced tools such as data mining, data modeling, data visualization,  
and information analysis etc. have been extensively researched  
recently. The objective of this workshop is to provide an interactive  
platform for academic researchers and industrial practitioners to  
exchange ideas, disseminate the latest development in data analytics  
and data visualization. Conceptual models, tools, and current issues  
are encouraged to be discussed. The workshop welcomes paper submission  
includes but not limited to the following areas:

  Data retrieval and management
  Innovative methods for understanding and interacting with data
  Innovative methods for data analysis, presentation and visualization
  Innovative methods for solving current data problems
  New statistics techniques for improving current solutions
  Advanced software system and algorithms for data visualization
  Domain specific data analytics and data visualization
  Social network analytics and visualization
  Forensic analytics and visualization
  Business process analytics and visualization
  Industry solutions and/or experiences
  Case studies


Submissions

Submissions should provide original and unpublished research results  
or ongoing research with simulations. The papers should be between 6  
to 8 pages total in length in the IEEE format.



* All the accepted papers will appear in the proceedings published by  
IEEE and fully indexed by IEEE Xplore.
All the ICDIM papers are indexed by DBLP
