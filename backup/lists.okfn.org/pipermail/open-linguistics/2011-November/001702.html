CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS

Edited Volume &quot;The People's Web Meets NLP: Collaboratively Constructed Language 
Resources&quot; 

<A HREF="http://www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/scientific-community/edited-book-the-peoples-web">http://www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/scientific-community/edited-book-the-peoples-web</A>

Springer book series: &quot;Theory and Applications of Natural Language 
Processing&quot;, E. Hovy, M. Johnson and G. Hirst (eds.) 


===Editors===

Iryna Gurevych and Jungi Kim


===Description===

The application of collective intelligence in the domain of language yielded 
collaboratively constructed language resources (CCLR) that can be used in a 
variety of ways. For example, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, and other language 
resources constructed through crowdsourcing such as Games with a Purpose and 
Mechanical Turk have been used in many ways in NLP. Researchers started using 
such resources to substitute for or supplement conventional lexical semantic 
resources such as WordNet or linguistically annotated corpora in different NLP 
tasks. Another research direction is to utilize NLP techniques to enhance the 
collaboration process and its outcome. Overall the emergence of CCLRs has 
generated new challenges to the research field that are to be addressed in the 
present book. As the research field of CCLRs matures, it has become necessary to 
summarize a set of results to advance and focus the further research effort. 

The aim of this book is to capture the state-of-the-art in the emerging area of 
research on &quot;Collaboratively constructed language resources.&quot; Thus, a point of 
reference on the topics of construction, mining, using and interconnecting 
collaboratively constructed language resources for natural language processing, 
knowledge discovery and other intelligent applications will be created 

Specific topics include but are not limited to:

 * Using CCLRs and the information mined from them for NLP tasks, such as word 
   sense disambiguation, semantic role labeling, information retrieval, text 
   categorization, information extraction, question answering, etc.; 
 * Mining social and collaborative content for constructing structured lexical 
   semantic resources, annotated corpora and the corresponding tools; 
 * Analyzing the structure of CCLRs related to their use in NLP;
 * Computational linguistics studies of CCLRS, such as wiki-based platforms or 
   folksonomies; 
 * Structural and semantic interoperability of CCLRs with conventional semantic 
   resources and between themselves; 
 * Mining multilingual information from CCLRs;
 * Using special features of CCLRs to create novel resource types, for example 
   revision-based corpora, simplified versions of resources, etc.; 
 * Quality and reliability of collaboratively constructed lexical semantic 
   resources and annotated corpora.

Further interactions can be spanned across the disciplinary boundaries, for 
example constructing language resources from user-generated contents through the 
collaborations with the research of discourse and social network analysis. 

Given the appropriateness of the topics, preliminary versions of contributions 
may be submitted in parallel to the 3rd workshop of &quot;The People's Web meets NLP: 
Collaboratively Constructed Semantic Resources and their Applications to NLP.&quot; 
Please refer to the workshop homepage shown below: 

<A HREF="http://www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/scientific-community/acl-2012-workshop">http://www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/scientific-community/acl-2012-workshop</A>

Please note: if accepted to the workshop, the papers will have to be 
substantially extended for the publication with Springer.
