<PRE>Dear all,

at first, thanks to Sebastian for announcing the resource creation  
challenge. If I may elaborate a bit: The idea of the ISWC meeting was to  
have a brain storming session on future activities of the working group.  
Assembling resources for a Linguistic LOD cloud was a very attractive  
option for the participants of the ISWC meeting, so, we will go for it.  
This does not, of course, rule out that other ideas are not pursued, as  
well, and we can continue brainstorming over the list.

At the very beginning, about a year ago, the working group concentrated on  
identifying some common goals for the working group (with results  
summarized in  
<A HREF="http://linguistics.okfn.org/2011/05/20/the-open-linguistics-working-group/">http://linguistics.okfn.org/2011/05/20/the-open-linguistics-working-group/</A>),  
and since spring this year, we tried to involve more people to reach a  
critical mass in order to come with some common activities (we had the  
OKCon workshop, and in March the LDL will follow). Now, there are around  
70 people on the list, and it would be interesting to see what we can  
achieve as a group.

There have been several ideas around before. We assembled a list of  
potentially interesting, mostly open resources and integrated some of them  
in CKAN. I personally liked Richard's earlier idea of a workflow  
repository (although I am not sure whether this is different from the  
goals of UiMA or GATE -- at least for the NLP community). And of course,  
there was the idea of a Linguistic LOD that seemed to be what most OKCon  
participants were heading for, including myself. The current resource  
creation drive is an experiment to see whether this idea can mobilize  
people to contribute actively, but other ideas are always welcome, too.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> People not present at the meeting are of course welcome to join in now.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We furthermore agreed to have regular telcos at intervals of either 1  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> month or 2 months, to be determined based on the outcome of the first
