CALL FOR PAPERS

ACL 2012 Third Workshop

The People's Web meets NLP:
Collaboratively Constructed Semantic Resources and their Applications to NLP

Jeju, Republic of Korea
July 12-13, 2012
<A HREF="http://www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/scientific-community/acl-2012-workshop">http://www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/scientific-community/acl-2012-workshop</A>


===Introduction===

Recent recognition of Collaboratively Constructed Semantic Resources (CSRs) such 
as Wikipedia [1], Wiktionary [2], Linked Open Data [3], and other resources 
developed using crowdsourcing such as Games with a Purpose [4] and Mechanical 
Turk [5] has substantially contributed to the research in natural language 
processing (NLP). 

Researchers started to use such resources to substitute for or supplement 
conventional lexical semantic resources such as WordNet or linguistically 
annotated corpora in different NLP tasks. Another research direction is to 
utilize NLP techniques to enhance the collaboration process and its outcome. 
This improves the overall quality of the CSRs [6,7]. Overall, the emergence of 
CSRs has generated new challenges to the research field that are to be addressed 
in the proposed workshop. 

The preceding &quot;The People's Web meets NLP&quot; workshops at ACL-IJCNLP 2009 and 
COLING 2010 have successfully gathered researchers from different areas, and 
enabled an interdisciplinary exchange of research outcomes and ideas. Such 
collaboration has contributed to the creation of valuable semantic resources and 
tools based on CSRs, such as word sense alignments between WordNet, Wikipedia, 
and Wiktionary [8,9,10], folksonomy and named entity ontologies [11,12], 
multiword terms [13], ontological resources [14,15], annotated corpora [16], and 
Wikipedia and Wiktionary APIs.  

The obvious next step in this area is to intensify research that demonstrates 
the effectiveness of the resources mined from CSRs as listed above in a variety 
of NLP tasks. This is why the 3rd workshop &quot;The People's Web meets NLP&quot; will 
especially welcome submissions that utilize resources and tools for CSRs. We 
invite both long and short papers and especially encourage to show the benefit 
of CSRs in diverse NLP tasks, for example word sense disambiguation [17] and 
semantic role labeling [18], in addition to further exploration of various 
aspects of CSRs. We also welcome tutorial-like submissions on using the software 
for CSRs to facilitate their wide adoption by the NLP community.

===Topics===

Specific topics include but are not limited to:

* Using collaboratively constructed resources and the information mined from 
  them for NLP tasks (cf. Section &quot;References&quot;), such as word sense 
  disambiguation, semantic role labeling, information retrieval, text 
  categorization, information extraction, question answering, etc.; 
* Mining social and collaborative content for constructing structured lexical 
  semantic resources, annotated corpora and the corresponding tools; 
* Analyzing the structure of collaboratively constructed resources related to 
  their use in NLP; 
* Computational linguistics studies of collaboratively constructed resources, 
  such as wiki-based platforms or folksonomies; 
* Structural and semantic interoperability of collaboratively constructed 
  resources with conventional semantic resources and between themselves; 
* Mining multilingual information from collaboratively constructed resources;
* Using special features of collaboratively constructed resources to create 
  novel resource types, for example revision-based corpora, simplified versions
  of resources, etc.; 
* Quality and reliability of collaboratively constructed lexical semantic 
  resources and annotated corpora; 
* Hands-on practical knowledge on utilization of CSR APIs and tools or designing 
  crowdsourcing procedures for high quality outcomes. 

Though the workshop welcomes any CSRs-related topics, preference will be given 
to submissions on CSRs' application to NLP tasks, which is the special interest 
of this workshop edition. Thereby, we encourage the participation of researchers 
with various backgrounds: from computational linguistics (e.g. parsing and 
discourse analysis) to NLP applications and other areas that might benefit from 
collaboratively constructed semantic resources. Given that we receive a 
sufficient number of tutorial-like submissions, a dedicated presentation session 
for those will be scheduled. 

Extended versions of the papers may be submitted in parallel for publication in 
an edited volume &quot;The People's Web Meets NLP: Collaboratively Constructed 
Language Resources.&quot; The book will be published in fall - winter 2012 as part
of the Springer book series: &quot;Theory and Applications of Natural Language 
Processing&quot;, E. Hovy, M. Johnson and G. Hirst (eds.). Please refer to the open 
call for contributions shown below:

===Submission Information===

The following is to be confirmed

Full paper submissions should follow the two-column format of ACL 2012 
proceedings without exceeding eight (8) pages of content plus one extra page for 
references. Short paper submissions should also follow the two-column format of 
ACL 2012 proceedings, and should not exceed four (4) pages, including 
references. We strongly recommend the use of ACL LaTeX style files or Microsoft 
 
 
Word Style files tailored for this year's conference, which are available on 
the conference website (<A HREF="http://www.acl2012.org/call/sub01.asp">http://www.acl2012.org/call/sub01.asp</A>). All submissions 
must conform to the official ACL 2012 style guidelines announced in the
conference website and they must be electronic in PDF. 

As the reviewing will be blind, the paper must not include the authors' names 
and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author's 
identity, e.g., &quot;We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...&quot;, must be avoided. 
Instead, use citations such as &quot;Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...&quot;. 
Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without 
review.  

Submission will be electronic using submission software 
(<A HREF="https://www.softconf.com/acl2012/people-web-2012">https://www.softconf.com/acl2012/people-web-2012</A>). All accepted papers will be 
presented orally and published in the workshop proceedings.

March 18, 2012          Paper submission deadline (full and short)
April 16, 2012          Notification of acceptance
April 30, 2012          Camera-ready version due
July 12-13, 2012        ACL 2012 Workshops

The exact date for the workshop &quot;The People's Web meets NLP: Collaboratively 
Constructed Semantic Resources and their Applications to NLP&quot; is yet to be
