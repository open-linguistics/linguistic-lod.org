Tenth International Conference on Digital Information Management
Jeju Island, South Korea
October 21-23, 2015
(www.icdim.org)
Technically co-sponsored by IEEE Technology Engineering Management Society
Proceedings will be indexed in IEEE Xplore


Following the successful earlier conferences at Bangalore (2006), Lyon  
(2007), London (2008), Michigan (2009) , Thunder Bay (2010), Melbourne

Management is a multidisciplinary conference on digital information  
management, science and technology. The principal aim of this  
conference is to bring people in academia, research laboratories and  
industry together, and offer a collaborative platform to address the  
emerging issues and solutions in digital information science and  
technology. The ICDIM intends to bridge the gap between different  
areas of digital information management, science and technology. This  
forum will address a large number of themes and issues. The conference  
will feature original research and industrial papers on the theory,  
design and implementation of digital information systems, as well as  
demonstrations, tutorials, workshops and industrial presentations.

The 10th International Conference on Digital Information Management
