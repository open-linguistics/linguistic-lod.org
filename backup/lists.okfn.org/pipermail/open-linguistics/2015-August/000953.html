********************************************************

*2^nd INTERNATIONAL WINTER SCHOOL ON BIG DATA*

**

*BigDat 201**6*

*Bilbao**, Spain***

*February 8-12, 2016***

Organized by:

DeustoUniversity

Rovira i Virgili University

<A HREF="http://grammars.grlmc.com/bigdat2016/">http://grammars.grlmc.com/bigdat2016/</A>

********************************************************

*AIM:*

BigDat 2016 will be a research training event addressed to graduates and 
postgraduates in the first steps of their academic career. With a global 
scope, it aims at updating them about the most recent advances in the 
critical and fast developing area of big data, which covers a large 
spectrum of current exciting research and industrial innovation with an 
extraordinary potential for a huge impact on scientific discoveries, 
medicine, engineering, business models, and society itself. Renowned 
academics and industry pioneers will lecture and share their views with 
the audience.

Most big data subareas will be displayed, namely: foundations, 
infrastructure, management, search and mining, security and privacy, and 
applications. Main challenges of analytics, management and storage of 
big data will be identified through 5 keynote lectures, 16 six-hour 
courses, and 1 round table, which will tackle the most active and 
promising topics. The organizers are convinced that outstanding speakers 
will attract the brightest and most motivated students. Interaction will 
be a main component of the event. An open session will give participants 
the opportunity to present their own work in progress in 5 minutes.

*ADDRESSED TO:*

Graduates and postgraduates from around the world. There are no formal 
pre-requisites in terms of academic degrees. However, since there will 
be differences in the course levels, specific knowledge background may 
be assumed for some of them. BigDat 2016 is also appropriate for more 
senior people who want to keep themselves updated on recent developments 
and future trends. All will surely find it fruitful to listen and 
discuss with major researchers, industry leaders and innovators.

*REGIME:*

In addition to keynotes, at least 2 courses will run in parallel during 
the whole event. Participants will be able to freely choose the courses 
they will be willing to attend as well as to move from one to another.

*VENUE:*

BigDat 2016 will take place in Bilbao, the capital of the Basque Country 
region, famous for its gastronomy and the seat of the Guggenheim Museum. 
The venue will be:

DeustoTech, School of Engineering

DeustoUniversity

Avda. Universidades, 24

48014 Bilbao

*ORGANIZING COMMITTEE:*

Adrian Horia Dediu

Carlos Mart&#237;n-Vide (co-chair)

*REGISTRATION:*

It has to be done at

<A HREF="http://grammars.grlmc.com/bigdat2016/registration.php">http://grammars.grlmc.com/bigdat2016/registration.php</A>

The selection of up to 8 courses requested in the registration template 
is only tentative and non-binding. For the sake of organization, it will 
be helpful to have an approximation of the respective demand for each 
course.

Since the capacity of the venue is limited, registration requests will 
be processed on a first come first served basis. The registration period 
will be closed and the on-line registration facility disabled when the 
capacity of the venue will be complete. It is much recommended to 
register prior to the event.

*FEES:*

Participants are expected to attend full-time. Fees are a flat rate 
allowing the attendance to all courses during the week. There are 
several early registration deadlines. Fees depend on the registration 
deadline.

*ACCOMMODATION:*

Suggestions of accommodation will be available on the webpage in due time.

*CERTIFICATE:*

Participants will be delivered a certificate of attendance.

*QUESTIONS AND FURTHER INFORMATION:*
