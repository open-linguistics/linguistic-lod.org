--- Early registration deadline: March 7, 2018 ---

&#160;

*****************************************************************************

&#160;
SCOPE:

&#160;

HighPer 2018 will be a research training event with a global scope aiming at updating participants about the most recent advances in the critical and fast developing area of high performance computing, which covers a large spectrum of current exciting research and industrial innovation with an extraordinary potential for a huge impact on scientific discoveries, medicine, engineering, business models, and society itself. Renowned academics and industry pioneers will lecture and share their views with the audience.

&#160;

Most subareas of high performance computing will be displayed, from foundations, infrastructure and management to applications. Major challenges in the field will be identified through 2 keynote lectures, 21 five-hour and fifteen-minute courses, and 1 round table, which will tackle the most active and promising topics. The organizers are convinced that outstanding speakers will attract the brightest and most motivated students. Interaction will be a main component of the event.

&#160;

An open session will give participants the opportunity to present their own work in progress in 5 minutes. Moreover, there will be two special sessions with industrial and recruitment profiles.

&#160;
ADDRESSED TO:

&#160;

Master students, PhD students, postdocs, and industry practitioners will be typical profiles of participants. However, there are no formal pre-requisites for attendance in terms of academic degrees. Since there will be a variety of levels, specific knowledge background may be assumed for some of the courses. Overall, HighPer 2018 is addressed to students, researchers and practitioners who want to keep themselves updated about recent developments and future trends. All will surely find it fruitful to listen and discuss with major researchers, industry leaders and innovators.

&#160;
STRUCTURE:

&#160;

3 courses will run in parallel during the whole event. Participants will be able to freely choose the courses they wish to attend as well as to move from one to another.

&#160;
VENUE:

&#160;

HighPer 2018 will take place in San Sebasti&#225;n, a famous touristic coastal city in the Basque Country which was European Capital of Culture 2016. The venue will be:
