SEMANTiCS&#8217;18 proceedings will be published as Open Access by Elsevier 
Procedia Computer Science.

The annual SEMANTiCS conference is the meeting place for professionals 
who make semantic computing work, understand its benefits, and encounter 
its limitations. Every year, SEMANTiCS attracts information managers, 
IT-architects, software engineers and researchers from a wide spectrum 
of organisations ranging from SMEs and non-profit organizations, to 
public administration bodies, to the largest companies in the world. 
Attendees learn from industry experts and top researchers about emerging 
trends and topics in the fields of semantic software, including 
enterprise data, linked data &amp; open data strategies, methodologies in 
knowledge modelling and text &amp; data analytics. The SEMANTiCS community 
is highly diverse; attendees routinely interlinking areas such as 
knowledge management, technical documentation, e-commerce, big data 
analysis, enterprise search, document management, business intelligence 
and enterprise vocabulary management.

Given the success of last year&#8217;s conference in Amsterdam, which 
attracted more than 370 attendees from 28 countries, SEMANTiCS 2018 is 
bound to continue a long tradition of bringing together a community from 
around the world. There will be presentations on industry 
implementations, use case prototypes, best practices, panels, papers and 
posters to discuss semantic systems in a broad range of regular as well 
as informal settings. SEMANTiCS addresses problems common among 
information managers, software engineers, IT-architects and various 
specialist departments working to develop, implement and evaluate 
semantic software systems.
The SEMANTiCS program will provide a rich mix of technical talks, panel 
discussions on emerging topics and presentations by people who make 
things work - just like you. In addition, attendees will have a unique 
opportunity to network with experts in a variety of fields. These 
relationships provide great value to organisations as they encounter 
technical challenges in any stage of implementation. The expertise 
gained by SEMANTiCS attendees has a long-term impact on their careers 
and organisations. These factors make SEMANTiCS the key event across 
Europe for a diverse community of industry leaders and academic experts 
alike.
Following the success of the previous year, this year&#8217;s SEMANTiCS will 
also again feature a special Data Science track, which offer a unique 
opportunity to bring together researchers and practitioners interested 
in the intersection of Semantic Technologies, Linked Data and Data 
Science and provide a platform to present their ideas and discuss the 
most important scientific, technical and socio-economic challenges in 
this emerging field.

SEMANTiCS 2018 particularly welcomes submissions on the following key 
topics:
*Web Semantics, Linked (Open) Data &amp; schema.org
*Corporate Knowledge Graphs
*Knowledge Integration and Language Technologies
*Data Quality Management

# Vocarnival
Bootstrap your new Vocabulary project: At the carnival you can present 
your ideas and early stage vocabs to find the right people to get the 
Vocab discussion going. For this event we use a very open definition of 
what a vocabulary is. Ontologies, classifications, thesauri, concept and 
metadata schemes, whatever their format, in RDF or not, are all welcome. 
We require at least a project website. Details to follow.

The detailed calls will be available on the conference website
