*Workshop for NLP Open Source Software (NLP-OSS)*
20 July 2018, Co-located with ACL 2018

**Extended** Deadline for Long and Short Paper submission: 8th April 2018

TL;DR
====


You have used NLP open source tools and bore grievances but found the
solution after hours of coffee and computer staring. Share that at NLP-OSS
and suggest how open source could change for the better (e.g. best
practices, documentation, API design etc.)

You've came across an awesome SOTA system on NLP task X that once ruled the
F1 score. But now the code is stale and it takes an dinosaur to understand
the code. Share your experience at NLP-OSS and propose how to &quot;replicate&quot;
these forgotten systems.

You have tried 101 NLP tools and there's none that really do what you want.
So you wrote your own shiny new package and made it open source. Tell us
why your package better than the existing tools, how did you design the
code? Is it going to be a one time thing? Or would you like to see
thousands of people using it? How would you grow your users and
co-contributors.

At last, you've found the avenue to air these issues in an academic
platform at the NLP-OSS workshop!!!

*Workshop for NLP Open Source Software (NLP-OSS)*
20 July 2018, Co-located with ACL 2018
<A HREF="https://nlposs.github.io/">https://nlposs.github.io/</A>

Deadline for Long and Short Paper submission: 8th April 2018
(23:59, GMT-11)
------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------

The First Workshop for NLP Open Source Software (NLP-OSS) will be
co-located
with ACL 2018 at Melbourne, Australia on 20 July 2018.

Focusing more on the social and engineering aspect of NLP software
and less on scientific novelty or state-of-art models, the Workshop for
NLP-OSS
is an academic forum to advance open source developments for NLP research,
teaching and application.

NLP-OSS also provides an academic workshop to announce new
software/features,
promote the collaborative culture and best practices that go beyond the
conferences.

We invite full papers (8 pages) or short papers (4 pages) on topics related
to
NLP-OSS broadly categorized into (i) software development, (ii) scientific
contribution and (iii) NLP-OSS case studies.

 - **Software Development**
   - Designing and developing NLP-OSS
   - Licensing issues in NLP-OSS
   - Backwards compatibility and stale code in NLP-OSS
   - Growing an NLP-OSS community
   - Maintaining and motivating an NLP-OSS community
   - Best practices for NLP-OSS documentation and testing
   - Contribution to NLP-OSS without coding
   - Incentivizing OSS contributions in NLP
   - Commercialization and Intellectual Property of NLP-OSS
   - Defining and managing NLP-OSS project scope
   - Issues in API design for NLP
   - NLP-OSS software interoperability
   - Analysis of the NLP-OSS community

 - **Scientific Contribution**
   - Surveying OSS for specific NLP task(s)
   - Demonstration and tutorial of NLP-OSS
   - New NLP-OSS introductions
   - Small but useful NLP-OSS
   - NLP components in ML OSS
   - Citations and references for NLP-OSS
   - OSS vs experiment replicability
   - Gaps between existing NLP-OSS
   - Task-generic vs task-specific software

 - **Case studies**
   - Case studies of how a specific bug is fixed or feature is added
   - Writing wrappers for other NLP-OSS
   - Writing open-source APIs for open data
   - Teaching NLP with OSS
   - NLP-OSS in the industry

Submission should be formatted according to the [ACL2018 templates](
