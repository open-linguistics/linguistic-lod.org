4TH WORKSHOP ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE WEB OF LINKED DATA  

First Call for Papers 

October 9, 2018 - Monterey, California, USA 

Workshop at ISWC 2018 

<A HREF="https://profs.info.uaic.ro/~rumour">https://profs.info.uaic.ro/~rumour</A> [1] 

OVERVIEW 

----------------------- 

Social media is a constant in our life, influencing the way we think,
interact, learn, consolidate relationships and understand society. As a
result of the rapid worldwide acceptance and usage of social media, more
and more content is becoming available as each day passes. Both because
of its importance and its increasing volume, it is not surprising that
information from Social Media is rapidly becoming an essential source
for natural language processing (NLP) research. 

At the same time, Linked Data is emerging as an increasingly important
topic for NLP. Work in the field has produced massive amounts of
linguistic data, including annotated corpora, lexicons, databases, and
ontologies, in formats that enable their exploitation in the Semantic
Web. Linking the contents of these resources to each other as well as to
knowledge sources in the Linked Data cloud can enable access to and
discovery of both detailed linguistic information and factual statements
contained in knowledge bases. This combination could foster a major leap
forward in NLP research and development. 

RUMOUR-2018 aims to gather innovative approaches for exploitation of
social media using semantic web technologies and linked data by bringing
together research on the Semantic Web, Linked Data, and the Social
Sciences. 

The workshop will bring together practitioners, researchers, and
scholars to share examples, use cases, theories, and analysis of social
media and linked data in order to address the intersection among these
areas. This intersection includes not only the challenges of problems
such as the understanding and acting upon large-scale data of different
kinds, provenance, and reliability, but also the use of these media for
data management, which involves issues of credibility, accountability,
trustworthiness, privacy, authenticity, and provision of provenance
information. 

TOPICS 

----------- 

The scientific program of RUMOUR-2018 will focus around the following
topics: 

 	* Social media and linked data methodologies in real-life scenarios;
 	* Creating and using structured social media-based resources through
social web mining;
 	* Novel analytical tools and methodologies of veracity detection;
 	* Semantic annotation;
 	* Ontological modeling of social media data;
 	* Ontological modeling of different levels of trust or &quot;veracity&quot;;
 	* Integration of social media with linked data;
 	* Extracting, understanding and predicting user and group behavior;
 	* Exploring crowdsourcing and user communities;
 	* Interactive interfaces and visual analytics methods;
 	* Computational social science for the semantic web;
 	* Strategic early warning systems and detection of week signals;
 	* User profiling, trustworthiness and assessing the suitability of
social media content;
 	* Sentiment analysis in social media and linked data;
 	* Using the social web to foster innovation.

SUBMISSION OF CONTRIBUTIONS 

---------------------------------------------------- 

We invite submissions of papers (up to 8 pages), representing original,
previously unpublished research, innovative approaches and resource
types, use cases or in-depth discussions. Submissions must use the PDF
file format and must adopt the style of the Springer Publications format
for Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS [2]). Details are provided
on Springer's Author Instructions page. Submissions that exceed the page
limit will be rejected without review. 

All submissions must be submitted online through the EasyChair system
following the submission link:
<A HREF="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=rumour2018.">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=rumour2018.</A> 

To ensure high quality, all papers will be thoroughly reviewed by the
RUMOUR2018 Program Committee. All reviews will be double blind, and
hence authors are instructed not to include their identity,
affiliation(s) or contact details, and to anonymize any references that
would reveal the authorship of the paper. Papers submitted to other
conferences or journals must state this fact. If a paper will appear in
another conference or journal, it must be withdrawn from RUMOUR. 

At least one author of each paper must register using the ISWC
registration [3] page to have the paper published in the RUMOUR-2018
Proceedings. All accepted papers must be presented at the workshop by
one of the authors.
