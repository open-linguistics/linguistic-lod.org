<PRE>Dear all,

those with ties into the humanities may have heard about Pelagios, a  
community concerned with entity linking for geographical references in  
historical texts and LOD-based GIS. Maybe, the micro-grants mentioned  
below are of interest, then, too.

Best,
Christian

The Pelagios project is happy to announce a new series of small grants (of  
up to &#163;4,000) to fund continued development within the scope of Pelagios  
in 2018. These are in two forms:

&#8226; Working Groups (WG), which will focus on extending Pelagios linked data  
methodologies into new areas, and/or establishing best practice within the  
community;

and

&#8226; Resource Development (RD), which will aim to produce digital tools and  
resources that are compatible with Pelagios linked data methodologies and  
that can be shared within the community.

Proposals for both WG and RD will be judged according to their relevance  
to and usefulness for the wider Pelagios community.

We specifically encourage submissions from libraries, archives and museums  
who are experimenting with Linked Open Data for their collections, and  
would be interested to explore ways to integrate this material into the  
Pelagios Linked Open Data ecosystem.

Projects which look to periods beyond the ancient world, and outside of  
the Mediterranean are also encouraged to apply.

If you are interested in either of these small grants schemes, please read  
more here.

The deadline for submissions is 29 March 2018.

For any enquiries, please email <A HREF="https://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-linguistics">commons at pelagios.org</A>
</PRE>
