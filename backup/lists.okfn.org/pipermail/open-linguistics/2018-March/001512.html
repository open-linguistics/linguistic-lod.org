About WICT'18:
--------------
WICT'18 aims to provide an opportunity for the researchers from academia
and industry to meet and discuss the latest solutions, scientific results
and methods in the usage and applications of ICT in the real world. The
conference programme includes workshops, special sessions and tutorials,
along with prominent keynote speakers and regular paper presentations in
parallel tracks. In the past century, our society has been through several
periods of dramatic changes, driven by innovations such as transportation
systems, telephone etc. Last few decades have experienced technologies that
are evolving so rapidly, altering the constraints of space and time, and
reshaping the way we communicate, learn and think. Rapid advances in
information technologies and other digital systems are reshaping our
ecosystem. Innovations in ICT allow us to transmit information quickly and
widely, propelling the growth of new urban communities, linking distant
places and diverse areas of endeavor in productive new ways, which a decade
ago was unimaginable. Thus, the theme of this World Congress is &quot;Innovating
ICT For Social Revolutions&quot;. All accepted and registered papers will be
included in the conference proceedings expected to be published by Springer.
