<PRE>CALL FOR PAPERS OF THE

4TH WORKSHOP ON SEMANTIC DEEP LEARNING (SemDeep-4) @ ISWC 2018

Monterey, California


Semantic Web (SW) Technologies and Deep Learning (DL) share the goal of 
creating intelligent artifacts. Both disciplines have had a remarkable 
impact in data and knowledge analysis, as well as knowledge 
representation, and in fact constitute two complementary directions for 
modeling expressible linguistic phenomena and solving semantically 
complex problems. In this context, and following the main foundations 
set in past editions, SemDeep-4 aims to bring together SW and DL 
research as well as industrial communities. SemDeep is interested in 
contributions of DL to classic problems in semantic applications, such 
as: (semi-automated) ontology learning, ontology alignment, ontology 
annotation, duplicate recognition, ontology prediction, knowledge base 
completion, relation extraction, and semantically grounded inference, 
among many others. At the same time, we invite contributions that 
analyse the interaction of SW technologies and resources with DL 
architectures, such as knowledge-based embeddings, collocation discovery 
and classification, or lexical entailment, to name only a few. This 
workshop seeks to provide an invigorating environment where semantically 
challenging problems which appeal to both Semantic Web and Computational 
Linguistic communities are addressed and discussed.


We invite submissions on any approach combining Semantic Web 
technologies and Deep Learning and suggest the following topics.

Structured knowledge in deep learning.

  *

    neural networks and logic rules for semantic compositionality

  *

    learning and applying knowledge graph embeddings to NLP tasks

  *

    learning semantic similarity and encoding distances as knowledge graph

  *

    ontology-based text classification

  *

    multilingual resources for neural representations of linguistics

  *

    semantic role labeling

Reasoning and inferences and deep learning

  *

    commonsense reasoning and vector space models

  *

    reasoning with deep learning methods

  *

    learning knowledge representations with deep learning

  *

    deep learning methods for knowledge-base completion

  *

    deep ontology learning

  *

    deep learning models for learning knowledge representations from text

  *

    deep learning ontological annotations

IMPORTANT DATES

*Firm* Submission deadline: June 1, 2018

Notification of acceptance: June 27, 2018

Camera-ready version: July 20, 2018

Workshop dates: October 8-9, 2018

SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

We invite three types of submissions:

 1.

    Long papers with new results (max. 12 pages)

 2.

    Short papers presenting innovative not fully empirically validated
    ideas or position papers (max. 4 pages)

 3.

    Short descriptions of systems that participate in the demo jam (max.
    4 pages)

All papers need to follow the LCNS formatting guidelines. The demo jam 
takes the format of system demonstrations where the theoretical 
background may be explained in the presentation slot and the functioning 
of the system is showcased in a 5 minute demo.
