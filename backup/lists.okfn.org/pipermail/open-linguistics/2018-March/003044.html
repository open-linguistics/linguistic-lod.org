<PRE>Dear Colleagues, 

Please, feel invited you and your colleagues, students, and other
collaborators to contribute your recent research to the 2nd MEDA 2018 -
Workshop on Curative Power of MEdical DAta held at the 18th Joint
Conference on Digital Libraries, JCDL 2018, 3-6 June 2018, Fort Worth,
Texas, US, ranked A* (CORE - <A HREF="http://103.1.187.206/core/">http://103.1.187.206/core/</A>). 

Profound regards,

3rd Call for participation   

MEDA 2018 - 2nd Workshop on Curative Power of MEdical DAta 

June 6, 2018 - Fort Worth, Texas, USA 

Workshop at JCDL 2018 

<A HREF="https://profs.info.uaic.ro/~meda">https://profs.info.uaic.ro/~meda</A> 

OVERVIEW 

----------------------- 

In an era when massive amounts of medical data became available,
researchers working in biological, biomedical and clinical domains have
increasingly started to require the help of language engineers to
process large quantities of biomedical and  molecular biology literature
(such as PubMed), patient data or health records. Linking the contents
of these documents to each other, as well as to specialized ontologies,
could enable access to and discovery of structured clinical information
and foster a major leap in natural language processing and health
research. 

MEDA-2018 aims to gather innovative approaches for the exploitation of
biomedical data using semantic web technologies and linked data by
bringing together practitioners, researchers, and scholars to share
examples, use cases, theories and analysis of biomedical data. The main
objective of this second edition workshop is to consolidate an
internationally appreciated forum for scientific research in BioMed,
with emphasis on crowdsourcing, semantic web, knowledge integration and
data linking. 

TOPICS 

----------- 

The scientific program of MEDA-2018 will focus around the following
topics: 

 	* Crowdsourcing approaches in biomedicine
 	* Collaborative computational technologies for biomedical research
 	* Biomedical corpus
 	* Mining biomedical literature
 	* Event-based text mining for biology and related fields
 	* Event and entity extraction in medical texts
 	* Conceptual graphs extracted from medical texts
 	* Annotation of semantic content, with applications in medicine and
biology
 	* Textual big data techniques
 	* Medical search engines
 	* Distributed communication system in biomedical applications
 	* Deep learning for bioinformatics
 	* Biomedical question/answering
 	* Biomedical digital libraries
 	* Biomedical topic modeling
 	* Biomedical language systems
 	* Text summarization in the biomedical domain.

SUBMISSION OF CONTRIBUTIONS 

---------------------------------------------------- 

We invite submissions of papers (up to 8 pages), representing original,
previously unpublished research, innovative approaches and resource
types, use cases or in-depth discussions. Submissions must use the PDF
file format and must adopt the style of the ACM Proceedings [1].
Submissions that exceed the page limit will be rejected without review. 

All submissions must be submitted online through the EasyChair system
following the submission link:
<A HREF="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=meda2018.">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=meda2018.</A> 

To ensure high quality, all papers will be thoroughly reviewed by the
MEDA2018 Program Committee. All reviews will be double blind, and hence
authors are instructed not to include their identity, affiliation(s) or
contact details, and to anonymize any references that would reveal the
authorship of the paper. Papers submitted to other conferences or
journals must state this fact. If a paper will appear in another
conference or journal, it must be withdrawn from MEDA. 

At least one author of each paper must register using the JCDL
registration page [2] to have the paper published in the MEDA-2018
Proceedings. All accepted papers must be presented at the workshop by
one of the authors. 

IMPORTANT DATES 

---------------------------------------------------- 

Submission of papers: March 9, 2018 

Notification of acceptance: March 30, 2018 

Early registration deadline: April 6, 2018 

Camera-ready papers: April 13, 2018
