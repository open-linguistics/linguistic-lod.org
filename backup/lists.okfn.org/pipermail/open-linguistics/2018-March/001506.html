<PRE>DEADLINE EXTENSION!

Call for Papers: Drift-a-LOD&#8217;18: Detection, Representation and Management of Concept Drift in Linked Open Data
Workshop at ESWC, Heraklion, Crete, Greece, June 3/4, 2018

#driftalod
<A HREF="https://event.cwi.nl/drift-a-lod/2018/">https://event.cwi.nl/drift-a-lod/2018/</A>

Extended Paper submission date: March 19, 2018.


The continuous growth of the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud is extending to various new domains. In many of these, facts change continuously: political landscapes evolve, medical discoveries lead to new cures, artists form new collaborations. In terms of knowledge representation, we observe that instances change their roles, new relations appear, old ones become invalid, and classes change both their definition and member-instances.

The evolution of LOD poses concrete new challenges to stakeholders: data publishers need to detect changes in the real world and capture them in their datasets; users and applications need automated tools to adapt querying over diachronic datasets; knowledge engineers want to understand modelling practices behind ontology changes; linguists study drift in the meaning of words. As a continuation of the previous two successful Drift-a-LOD editions, this workshop seeks to form a community of researchers and practitioners working on detecting, representing and managing concept drift in and for LOD.

Drift-a-LOD&#8217;18 will bring together different communities that define, identify and manage the dynamics of concepts in their knowledge bases using various domain-specific methods (statistical inference, symbolic reasoning, natural language processing, etc.), leveraging the LOD cloud as a data source or as a result publishing platform.



== TOPICS ==

Topics of interest include, but are not restricted to:

* detecting and predicting concept drift (using any method, incl. reasoning, data mining, word embeddings, NLP)
* representation of concept drift
* reasoning, querying, machine learning in the presence of evolving knowledge and drifting concepts
* theoretical explanations of drift dynamics
* visualization and presentation of evolving knowledge
* ontology evolution and concept drift
* tools and systems for fine-grained, semantically-aware ontology version control
* empirical studies of how concepts drift
* evaluation of concept drift detection methods
* applications working in the presence of concept drift
* frameworks addressing concept identity over time
* frameworks for monitoring/recording concept drift on a large scale (&#8216;drift observatories&#8217;)

== IMPORTANT DATES ==

Friday March 19, 2018: extended deadline to submit papers
Friday April 6, 2018: notifications to authors
Friday April 13, 2018: camera ready versions
June 3 or 4, 2018: workshop

== SUBMISSION GUIDELINES ==

We invite full papers and short papers. Submissions must be in PDF, formatted in the style of the Springer Publications format for Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS). For details on the LNCS style, see Springer&#8217;s Author Instructions at <A HREF="http://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines.">http://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines.</A> Contributions should not exceed 8 pages in length for full papers and 5 pages for short papers, including references and optional appendices. Papers can be submitted through the EasyChair submission system at <A HREF="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=driftalod2018.">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=driftalod2018.</A>

Contributions may be accepted as either long of short presentations depending on quality, novelty, and potential to stimulate a discussion at the workshop. Accepted contributions will be published on the CEUR-WS website (or equivalent). At least one author needs to register for the workshop. Registration for the ESWC conference is mandatory for registration for the Drift-a-LOD workshop.

== WORKSHOP ORGANIZERS ==

Efstratios Kontopoulos, Center for Research &amp; Technology Hellas, Greece
Albert Mero&#241;o Pe&#241;uela, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, The Netherlands
Laura Hollink, Centrum Wiskunde &amp; Informatica, The Netherlands
