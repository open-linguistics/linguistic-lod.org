1st International Conference on Language, Data and Knowledge (LDK 2017,
June 18-19)


*-- Early Bird Registration until May 10! --*

<A HREF="http://www.ldk2017.org/">http://www.ldk2017.org/</A>

The new biennial conference series on Language, Data and Knowledge (LDK)
aims at bringing together researchers from across disciplines concerned
with the acquisition, curation and use of language data in the context of data
science and knowledge-based applications. With the advent of the Web and
digital technologies, an ever increasing amount of language data is now
available across application areas and industry sectors, including social
media, digital archives, company records, etc. The efficient and meaningful
exploitation of this data in scientific and commercial innovation is at the
core of data science research, employing NLP and machine learning methods
as well as semantic technologies based on knowledge graphs.

Language data is of increasing importance to machine learning-based
approaches in NLP, Linked Data and Semantic Web research and applications
that depend on linguistic and semantic annotation with lexical,
terminological and ontological resources, manual alignment across language
or other human-assigned labels. The acquisition, provenance,
representation, maintenance, usability, quality as well as legal,
organizational and infrastructure aspects of language data are therefore
rapidly becoming major areas of research that are at the focus of the
conference.

Knowledge graphs is an active field of research concerned with the
extraction, integration, maintenance and use of semantic representations of
language data in combination with semantically or otherwise structured
data, numerical data and multimodal data among others. Knowledge graph
research builds on the exploitation and extension of lexical,
terminological and ontological resources, information and knowledge
extraction, entity linking, ontology learning, ontology alignment, semantic
text similarity, Linked Data and other Semantic Web technologies. The
construction and use of knowledge graphs from language data, possibly and
ideally in the context of other types of data, is a further specific focus
of the conference.

A further focus of the conference is the combined use and exploitation of
language data and knowledge graphs in data science-based approaches to use
cases in industry, including biomedical applications, as well as use cases
in humanities and social sciences.

The LDK conference has been initiated by a consortium of researchers from
the Insight Centre for Data Analytics, InfAI (University Leipzig) and
Wolfgang Goethe University and a Scientific Committee of leading
researchers in Natural Language Processing, Linked Data and Semantic Web,
Language Resources and Digital Humanities. LDK is endorsed by several
international organisations: DBpedia, ACL SIGANN, Global Wordnet
Association, CLARIN and Big Data Value Association (BDVA). The first
edition, LDK 2017, will be held in Galway (Ireland) with a second edition
planned for 2019 in Leipzig (Germany).
