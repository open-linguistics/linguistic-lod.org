***************************************************************************

&#160;
AIMS:

&#160;

TPNC is a conference series intending to cover the wide spectrum of computational principles, models and techniques inspired by information processing in nature. TPNC 2017 will reserve significant room for young scholars at the beginning of their career and particular focus will be put on methodology. The conference aims at attracting contributions to nature-inspired models of computation, synthesizing nature by means of computation, nature-inspired materials, and information processing in nature.

&#160;
VENUE:

&#160;

TPNC 2017 will take place in Prague, whose historic centre is UNESCO World Heritage Site and which is home to famous attractions like the Prague Castle, the Charles Bridge, etc. The venue will be:

&#160;

Faculty of Mathematics and Physics

Charles University

Ke Karlovu 3

121 16 Praha 2

&#160;
SCOPE:

&#160;

Topics include, but are not limited to:

&#160;

- Theoretical contributions to:

&#160;
