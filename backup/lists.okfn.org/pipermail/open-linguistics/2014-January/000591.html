<PRE>Linked Data in Linguistics 2014 - Data Challenge
Collocated with LREC 2014
Reykjavik, Iceland, 27th May 2014

Call for Datasets
=================

The explosion of information technology has led to a substantial growth in
quantity, diversity and complexity of linguistic data accessible on the
Web. The
lack of interoperability between linguistic and language resources
represents a
major challenge that needs to be addressed, in particular, if information
from
different sources is to be combined, such as machine-readable lexicons,
corpus
data and terminology repositories. The Linked Data in Linguistics (LDL)
workshop
series provides a forum to discuss these types of resources, strategies to
address issues of interoperability between them, protocols to distribute,
access
and integrate this information and technologies and infrastructures
developed on
this basis.

This year, there is a data challenge associated to the Linguistic Linked
Data
Workshop. In addition to regular workshop papers, we will accept dataset
description of 4-6 pages describing linguistically or NLP-relevant datasets
published on the web as linked data published on the web as linked data.
These
linguistic datasets include, but are not limited to, lexica, terminologies,
semantic networks, annotated and parallel corpora, multimodal resources,
typological resources and linguistic metadata. The data challenge committee
will
review and evaluate data according to the following criteria, with prizes
of up
to &#8364;700, funded by the LIDER project, awarded to the highest scoring
datasets:

* Availability
** Use of Linked Data and RDF.
** Hosted on a publicly accessible server and be available both during the
   period of the evaluation and beyond.
** Use of an open license.
* Quality of Resource
** Represents useful linguistically or NLP-relevant information.
** Reuses relevant standards and models.
** Contains complex, non-trivial information, e.g., multiple levels of
   annotation.
* Linking
** Links to external resources.
** Reuse of existing properties and categories.
* Impact/usefulness of the resource
** Relevant and likely to be reused by many researchers in NLP and wider
fields.
** Uses linked data to improve the quality of and access to the resource.
* Originality
** Represents a type of resource or a community currently under-represented
in
   (L)LOD cloud activities
** Facilitates novel and unforeseen applications or use cases (as described
by
   the authors) enabled through Linked Data technology.

Submission &amp; Publication
==========================

We accept dataset descriptions of 4-6 pages, which include a URL under
which the
data is available. The papers of the workshop will be published as online
proceedings. All submissions can be presented as lightning talks or posters,
albeit such a presentation is optional. In addition, we aim for a journal
special issue as post-conference proceedings in which a selected amount of
papers presented at the workshop will be published. When submitting a
dataset
description, authors will be asked to provide essential information about
resources (in a broad sense, i.e. also technologies, standards, evaluation
kits,
etc.) that have been used for the work described in the paper or are a new
result of your research. Moreover, ELRA encourages all LREC authors to
share the
described LRs (data, tools, services, etc.), to enable their reuse,
replicability of experiments, including evaluation ones, etc. For contact
data,
stylesheets, up-to-date details on submission and the workshop itself,
please
consult our website: <A HREF="http://ldl2014.org.">http://ldl2014.org.</A> Specific details on dataset
submissions
and the challenge can be found under <A HREF="http://ldl2014.org/challenge.html.">http://ldl2014.org/challenge.html.</A>

Timeline
