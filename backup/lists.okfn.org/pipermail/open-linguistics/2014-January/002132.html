<PRE>Hi,

I love (ironic) the following paragraph of the announcement which has 
just appeared on the list! This will make my day !

/&quot;//Women are expressly invited to submit their application. According 
to the pursuant legal requirements, applicants with disabilities will be 
preferably treated in the appointment procedure. &quot;/



Audrey Baneyx, a woman and also a computational linguist, with a PhD in 
AI and so on

Le 09/01/2014 13:05, Jungi Kim a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> The German Institute for International Educational Research (DIPF)
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://www.dipf.de/">http://www.dipf.de/</A>) in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, is a member of the
</I>&gt;<i> Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Association of Sciences. As a national centre for
</I>&gt;<i> educational research and educational information, it is jointly funded by the
</I>&gt;<i> federal government (Bund) and the states (L&#228;nder).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At DIPF, the research unit &#8220;Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing Lab&#8220; at the
</I>&gt;<i> Information Center for Education (located in Frankfurt am Main, Germany) is
</I>&gt;<i> looking for an
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Research Scientist for Automated Language Processing / Text Mining / Digital
</I>&gt;<i> Humanities (three-year contract, full time, EG13 TV-H*)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The position is situated in the context of the project &#8220;Die Welt der Kinder:
</I>&gt;<i> Weltwissen und Weltdeutung in Schul- und Kinderb&#252;chern zwischen 1850 und 1918&#8220;
</I>&gt;<i> [children&#8217;s worlds: knowledge and interpretation of the world in  textbooks and
</I>&gt;<i> children&#8217;s books from 1850 to 1918], subject to the Leibniz competition for
</I>&gt;<i> excellence. Here, DIPF collaborates with the Georg-Eckert Institute for
</I>&gt;<i> International Textbook Research (Brunswick) and the Institute for Language
</I>&gt;<i> Technology and Information Science (University of Hildesheim).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The project targets research into historical textbooks and children&#8217;s books -
</I>&gt;<i> and the analysis of world views children grew up with. In the project, classical
</I>&gt;<i> qualitative methods used in historical sciences to analyse texts that are
</I>&gt;<i> charged with interpretation will be interlinked with automatic indexing and
</I>&gt;<i> semantic annotation of historical sources by means of semantic language
</I>&gt;<i> processing methods. First and foremost, Topic Detection and Opinion Mining
</I>&gt;<i> methods will be explored and further developed. So far, no training data exist
</I>&gt;<i> for the analysis of historical texts in German. Thus, the appointment addresses
</I>&gt;<i> a genuine task in the context of innovative digital humanities, targeting the
</I>&gt;<i> implementation of unsupervised and adaptive language processing methods. Another
</I>&gt;<i> innovative aspect concerns the close collaboration with users and the linkage of
</I>&gt;<i> intellectual with automated methods of analysis.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The position is integrated into a highly dynamic environment at DIPF and TU
</I>&gt;<i> Darmstadt. At DIPF, the successful candidate will co-operate with researchers in
</I>&gt;<i> the growing domain of &#8220;Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing&#8221;, with computer science
</I>&gt;<i> and educational research groups and information services, e.g. the Research
</I>&gt;<i> Library for  the History of Education (BBF) at DIPF. At TU Darmstadt, a close
</I>&gt;<i> co-operation exists concerning the UKP Lab (Prof. Dr. Iryna Gurevych), and
</I>&gt;<i> research groups focusing text and data mining as well as partners from digital
</I>&gt;<i> humanities projects at Darmstadt and at national levels (DARIAH-DE, CLARIN and
</I>&gt;<i> LOEWE priority &#8220;Digital Humanities&#8220; in the state of Hesse).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We invite excellently qualified postgraduates or excellent graduates from
</I>&gt;<i> relevant study courses to apply (Computer Science, Computational Linguistics or
</I>&gt;<i> related subjects).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Requirements:
</I>&gt;<i> - Doctoral degree or diploma/master degree in Computer Science, Computational
</I>&gt;<i> Linguistics or other relevant subjects;
</I>&gt;<i> - Preferably very good programming skills in Java and Web technologies;
</I>&gt;<i> knowledge of UIMA;
</I>&gt;<i> - Very good English language skills (written and spoken) and at least basic
</I>&gt;<i> knowledge of German;
</I>&gt;<i> - Ability to work independently, commitment to the task, the ability to work and
</I>&gt;<i> communicate in a team and readiness to co-operate;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Experience in automated language processing, text mining or digital humanities
</I>&gt;<i> is preferred.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Women are expressly invited to submit their application. According to the
</I>&gt;<i> pursuant legal requirements, applicants with disabilities will be preferably
</I>&gt;<i> treated in the appointment procedure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Owing to the duration of the project, a contract will be signed for three years.
</I>&gt;<i> TU Darmstadt offers an opportunity for further scientific qualification (i.e.
</I>&gt;<i> doctoral degree, habilitation). The salary complies with TV-H (public service
</I>&gt;<i> labour agreement in the state of Hesse). Applicants will principally be able to
</I>&gt;<i> work part-time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a scientific institution and member of the Leibniz Association, DIPF targets
</I>&gt;<i> high-quality fundamental research as well as a research-based development of
</I>&gt;<i> innovative scientific services. It addresses education as a public domain with
</I>&gt;<i> high visibility and high importance.
</I>&gt;<i> By bringing together competencies, DIPF and Computer Science at TU Darmstadt are
</I>&gt;<i> setting up a priority domain of knowledge processing and computer science in
</I>&gt;<i> education.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In relevant national rankings, the Computer Science department at TU Darmstadt
</I>&gt;<i> regularly holds top positions. In 2012, the UKP-DIPF group was established: its
</I>&gt;<i> unique features include semantic language processing, text mining and
</I>&gt;<i> information retrieval as well as powerful infrastructures for evaluating and
</I>&gt;<i> aggregating knowledge.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Candidates are requested to submit their application in electronic form
</I>&gt;<i> (including CV and information regarding scientific work experience, university
</I>&gt;<i> and work reports/references including electronic versions of the thesis and/or
</I>&gt;<i> three key publications as well as names of two references), quoting the
</I>&gt;<i> reference code (Referenz-Nr. IZB 2014-02). Please e-mail by February 14, 2014 to
</I>&gt;<i> Prof. Dr. Iryna Gurevych, German Institute for International Educational
</I>&gt;<i> Research (DIPF), Postfach 900270, 60442 Frankfurt am Main, Germany, i.e.
</I>&gt;<i> office-ukp (at) dipf (dot) de. If you have any further questions, please contact
</I>&gt;<i> Prof. Gurevych by e-mail: gurevych (at) dipf (dot) de.
