<PRE>Hi Christian,

Excellent! I'm pleased to hear it - but didn't want to push something
that might not fit. I'm not a linguist by any stretch, but hey. Open
data makes for a motley research community.

This sounds encouraging. I have some background list archive reading to
do to get up on the context so far, but I think the small
ethnolinguistic data sets I've seen and the language typology /
documentation data sets I just found look identical in terms of their
rights requirements, although I imagine there will be different academic
cultures of access/sharing.

For the ODD all I was hoping to achieve was to find out who is doing
something in this area and what the state of play is with small
linguistic/ethno data sets. So far all I've seen in the various
conferences / departments / workshops I've visited is frustration at the
situation and total lack of awareness of open data initiatives.

&gt;<i> I would personally discourage starting an new OKFN working group as

</I>
I hear that loud and clear :) I haven't organised an OKFN working group
since the dark ages (well, 2005) and I'm not in a hurry to shovel time
and energy into new initiatives - especially when existing ones are so
welcoming.  Thanks!

So, I'd be very pleased to participate in the next telco and have this
item on the agenda. 

There's nobody self-identifying as being in London on the wiki page. Any
locals on this list? Or anyone planning to do anything for their local
ODD already?

Cheers,

Saul.
