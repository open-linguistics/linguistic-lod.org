<PRE>The Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing Lab (UKP Lab) offers several exciting
internship opportunities in cutting-edge research projects as 

Research Intern in Natural Language Processing (NLP) / Text Mining / Digital
Humanities 

located either at the Computer Science Department of the Technische Universit&#228;t
Darmstadt or at the Information Center for Education at DIPF in Frankfurt
(Germany) 

The positions are situated within one of the Lab&#8217;s projects dealing with
automatic text processing, linguistic and machine learning based methods of
language analysis, corpus development for novel tasks, or tool support for users
in NLP research and humanities. The Lab&#8217;s approach to NLP features the hybrid
methods in large-scale language processing, real-world text mining, and hands-on
skills in the rapid development of scalable systems with practical relevance. 

Requirements: We are looking for internship students to work on one of the
following areas: computational linguistics, text mining, or machine learning,
with substantial theoretical knowledge, excellent problem-solving and
programming (Java) skills for language processing, eagerness to apply the
knowledge and skills in new contexts, and interest to participate in the Lab&#8217;s
internationally competitive research. The ability to work independently,
personal commitment, teamwork and communication skills, and a readiness to
cooperate are required. The ability to speak German as well as previous
experience in NLP, text-mining, or digital humanities are beneficial, but is not
a job requirement. 

We welcome applications of students at all levels of study (bachelor, master) as
well as graduate-level applications. The position is ideally suited to acquire
research experience abroad (also as required by the ongoing study program of an
applicant), or qualify as a Master-, PhD-student, or a research associate at one
of the leading universities, and for a competitive industry position. 

The position is a fixed-term internship contract (6 months) with an option to
extend it up to 1 year, provided certain conditions are met. A part-time working
arrangement is possible.&#160;The internships are funded according to the level of
qualification, previous experience, and formal criteria. 

The Computer Science Department of the Technische Universit&#228;t Darmstadt is
regularly ranked among the best in Germany. The Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing
Lab (UKP Lab) in Darmstadt/Frankfurt (www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de) led by Professor
Iryna Gurevych offers an excellent research environment. The distinguishing
features of its research are novel linked lexical semantic resources, algorithms
for semantic language analysis (for example, word sense disambiguation, or
semantic role labeling), and text-mining (for example, topic recognition, or
opinion analysis). The ongoing research projects closely cooperate with users of
the developed technologies in humanities, e.g. in educational research, text
interpretation in philosophy, corpus linguistics, or history sciences. Within
the graduate program &#8220;Knowledge Discovery in Scientific Literature&#8221;
(<A HREF="http://www.kdsl.tu-darmstadt.de/">http://www.kdsl.tu-darmstadt.de/</A>), the UKP Lab is networked with multiple
groups in machine learning, statistical NLP and information management.

Applications (including CV, details of previous academic work, at least two
educational and professional references, and final thesis in electronic form)
should be submitted to gurevych (at) cs (dot) tu-darmstadt (dot) de.
