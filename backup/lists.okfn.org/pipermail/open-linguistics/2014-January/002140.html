<PRE>Hi Saul, Christian, OpenLinguists,

Quick Note Re Open Data Day:

Open Data Day in London: The Open Knowledge Foundation is organising an
OpenData Day event in London at the Centre for Creative Collaboration,
details can be found on the OKFN England
page&lt;<A HREF="http://en.okfn.org/open-data-day-2014/">http://en.okfn.org/open-data-day-2014/</A>&gt; (where
you can sign up to attend) and if you would like to propose a topic, the
discussion is happening on the OKFN EN mailing list
&lt;<A HREF="https://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-linguistics">okfn-en at lists.okfn.org</A>&gt;, although
I am sure you can also arrive on the day and propose a topic as well! We
would love to see some Open Linguists attending.

This was just announced yesterday so it is quite possible we haven't
updated the wiki, I will make sure to do that today!

Looking forward to seeing you there.

All the best,
Katelyn

</I>&gt;<i> Excellent! I'm pleased to hear it - but didn't want to push something
</I>&gt;<i> that might not fit. I'm not a linguist by any stretch, but hey. Open
</I>&gt;<i> data makes for a motley research community.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Linked Open Data stuff). But in any case, everyone on the list would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; welcome discussions about the legal situation.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The type of data you describe would be very similar to datasets from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; typology and language documentation, and a workshop on such kind of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; data could continue, e.g., earlier activities such as the Linked
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Data in Typology track of the ALT conference organized by Sebastian
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Nordhoff this summer. If you want to organize something in this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; direction under the umbrella of the OWLG, we can add this as a topic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for discussion to the agenda for the next telco, and you may get in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; direct touch with the typology (etc.) folks on the list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This sounds encouraging. I have some background list archive reading to
</I>&gt;<i> do to get up on the context so far, but I think the small
</I>&gt;<i> ethnolinguistic data sets I've seen and the language typology /
</I>&gt;<i> documentation data sets I just found look identical in terms of their
</I>&gt;<i> rights requirements, although I imagine there will be different academic
</I>&gt;<i> cultures of access/sharing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For the ODD all I was hoping to achieve was to find out who is doing
</I>&gt;<i> something in this area and what the state of play is with small
</I>&gt;<i> linguistic/ethno data sets. So far all I've seen in the various
</I>&gt;<i> conferences / departments / workshops I've visited is frustration at the
</I>&gt;<i> situation and total lack of awareness of open data initiatives.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I would personally discourage starting an new OKFN working group as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; long as your area of expertise and your interests overlaps with the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; scope of an existing one -- unless you already have strong community
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ties you can build on. Founding is easy, but not all groups I joined
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are equally active, and those that are seem to live from the energy
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of very few dedicated people, so you would have to prepare for a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; huge investment of time and energy if you want to really keep it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; alive ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hear that loud and clear :) I haven't organised an OKFN working group
</I>&gt;<i> since the dark ages (well, 2005) and I'm not in a hurry to shovel time
</I>&gt;<i> and energy into new initiatives - especially when existing ones are so
</I>&gt;<i> welcoming.  Thanks!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, I'd be very pleased to participate in the next telco and have this
</I>&gt;<i> item on the agenda.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There's nobody self-identifying as being in London on the wiki page. Any
</I>&gt;<i> locals on this list? Or anyone planning to do anything for their local
</I>&gt;<i> ODD already?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Saul.
