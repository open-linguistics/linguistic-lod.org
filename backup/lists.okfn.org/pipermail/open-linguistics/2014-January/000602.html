Call for papers: Special Issue of the International Journal On Semantic Web
and Information Systems &lt;<A HREF="http://www.ijswis.org/">http://www.ijswis.org/</A>&gt; on

The Ubiquitous Semantic Web &lt;<A HREF="http://www.ijswis.org/?q=node/49">http://www.ijswis.org/?q=node/49</A>&gt;


*Introduction *The recent years have witnessed an explosive growth of smart
devices (phones, tablets, etc.), with iOS and Android being the two leading
platforms. Collectively Android and iOS dominate the smart devices market,
accounting for more than 90% of the market share.

Typically equipped with a comprehensive operating system, versatile
connectivity options, rich multimedia support, various sensing capabilities
and generous computational resources, smart, mobile devices has truly
enabled ubiquitous and situation-aware communication. We believe it is an
area of tremendous growth potential for the adoption of semantic
technologies.

After more than a decade of active research, tremendous progress has been
made in fundamental research areas, including ontology reasoning, query
answering, Linked Data, among others. However, the mobile setting is an
emerging research area and many unique challenges need to be addressed for
realizing the ubiquitous Semantic Web. On portable devices, such challenges
include, for example, limited computing capabilities, battery power,
connectivity and bandwidth, trustworthiness of devices, services,
context-aware semantic computing, user profiling, privacy issues, to name a
few.

The special issue welcomes original, high-quality research works on the
Ubiquitous Semantic Web. These include theoretical, applied research as
well as descriptions of innovative application of Semantic Web technologies
in the ubiquitous setting. Wherever applicable, submissions should
demonstrate the contribution of the research through a systematic
evaluation.

*Topics*
Topics of interests for the special issue include, but are not limited to:

   - The optimization and adaptation of semantic infrastructure (ontology
   reasoning, SPARQL and conjunctive query answering, etc.) on mobile devices:
   performance, scalability, power consumption, etc.
   - User and context modeling
   - Presentation and visualization of semantic data on mobile devices
   - Production and consumption of semantic data on mobile devices
   - Security, trust, and privacy issues on the Ubiquitous Semantic Web
   - Semantic sensors and sensor networks
   - Linked Stream Data processing
   - Semantic, context-aware matchmaking
   - Semantic ubiquitous cloud computing
   - Development, testing, deployment tools and environment for ubiquitous
   semantic applications
   - Application of Semantic Web languages, techniques and systems on
   mobile devices

*Submissions*
Submissions to this special issue should follow the journal's guidelines
for submission&lt;<A HREF="http://www.knoesis.org/resources/ijswis/GuidelinesForSubmission2013.doc">http://www.knoesis.org/resources/ijswis/GuidelinesForSubmission2013.doc</A>&gt;.
After submitting the paper, please also inform the guest editors by email,
indicating the paper ID assigned by the submission system. If a submission
is based on a prior conference or workshop publication, the journal
submission must demonstrate substantial differences/improvement. For such
an extended manuscript, please explicitly cite previous publications on
which the current submission is based, along with a note explaining the
main differences/improvements.
