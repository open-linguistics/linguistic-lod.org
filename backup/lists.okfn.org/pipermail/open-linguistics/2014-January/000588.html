<PRE>The German Institute for International Educational Research (DIPF)
(<A HREF="http://www.dipf.de/">http://www.dipf.de/</A>) in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, is a member of the
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Association of Sciences. As a national centre for
educational research and educational information, it is jointly funded by the
federal government (Bund) and the states (L&#228;nder). 

At DIPF, the Information Center for Education (located in Frankfurt am Main) is
looking for a 

Research Scientist (two-year contract, full time, EG13 TV-H*)

for tasks in the field of scientific coordination and transfer in computer
science, knowledge and language processing.

The position concerns scientific coordination and transfer tasks in the context
of the postgraduate programme Knowledge Discovery in Scientific Literature
(<A HREF="http://www.kdsl.tu-darmstadt.de/">http://www.kdsl.tu-darmstadt.de/</A>), founded in 2013  at DIPF and TU Darmstadt,
focusing on computational linguistics and language technology. It is nested in
the research priority of &#8220;computer science for educational research&#8221;, newly
established at the Information Centre for Education.  The successful candidate
will collaborate closely with the Computer Science Department (Prof. Dr. Iryna
Gurevych) at Technical University Darmstadt; the position is at the core of the
newly established institutional focus on knowledge processing
(<A HREF="http://www.werc.tu-darmstadt.de/">http://www.werc.tu-darmstadt.de/</A>) at DIPF and Technical University Darmstadt.

The successful candidate will be expected to coordinate research in the study
and qualification programme of the postgraduate programme, monitor the
postgraduate programme and its five students and contribute to the transfer of
technology. Furthermore, we expect the successful candidate to actively engage
in defining requirements, coordinating the assessment of needs and conducting
user workshops.

The position functions as an interface between research on automated analysis of
research literature on the one hand and information services respectively
information technologies at DIPF on the other. We aim to adapt innovative
methods in computer science, language technology and information management to
the educational researchers&#8217; needs. These activities target novel means of
access to digital science literature and on the web. 
We welcome applications from excellently qualified postdoctoral candidates and
(in exceptional cases) excellent graduates striving for further qualification in
a scientific-technological field and in research management.  

Requirements: 
- A very good or excellent doctoral degree or likewise excellent diploma/masters
degree in computer science, computational linguistics or a related subject
domain;
- Very good English language skills (written and spoken) and at least basic
skills in German;
- Ability to work independently, commitment to the task, the ability to work and
communicate in a team and readiness to cooperate;
- Experience in coordinating distributed software development and its
Integration;
- Experience in conceptualising and conducting events for scientists, users, and
the public.
- Preferably experience in information and text processing, machine learning,
very good Java programming skills and knowledge of UIMA, experience with
larger-scale software projects.

Candidates are expected to provide certification of their experience in
scientific publishing, acquisition of external funding and project management.

Women are expressly invited to submit their application. According to the
pursuant legal requirements, applicants with disabilities will be preferably
treated in the appointment procedure. 

A contract will initially be signed for two years. TU Darmstadt offers an
opportunity for further scientific qualification (i.e. doctoral degree,
habilitation). The salary complies with TV-H (public service labour agreement in
the state of Hesse). Applicants will principally be able to work part-time. 

As a scientific institution and member of the Leibniz Association, DIPF targets
high-quality fundamental research as well as a research-based development of
innovative scientific services. It addresses education as a public domain with
high effectiveness and high importance. In relevant national rankings, the
Computer Science department at TU Darmstadt regularly holds top positions. Its
unique character is marked by excellent competencies in the fields of knowledge
discovery on the web focusing on semantic language technology: text mining and
information retrieval. By bringing competencies together, DIPF - with Computer
Science at TU Darmstadt - has set up an institutional priority domain on
knowledge processing and computer science in education.

Candidates are requested to submit their application in electronic form
(including CV and information regarding scientific work experience, university
and work reports/references including electronic versions of the thesis and/or
three key publications as well as names of two references), quoting the
reference code (Referenz-Nr. IZB 2014-01). Please e-mail by February 14, 2014 to
Prof. Dr. Iryna Gurevych, German Institute for International Educational
Research (DIPF), Postfach 900270, 60442 Frankfurt am Main, Germany, i.e.
office-ukp (at) dipf (dot) de. If you have any further questions, please contact
Prof. Gurevych by e-mail: gurevych (at) dipf (dot) de.
