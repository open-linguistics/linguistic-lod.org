Please distribute to everybody who might be interested:

HTML version here: <A HREF="http://hpsg.fu-berlin.de/OALI/jobs.html">http://hpsg.fu-berlin.de/OALI/jobs.html</A>

Language Science Press (<A HREF="http://langsci-press.org">http://langsci-press.org</A>) is a publication unit
at the Freie Universit&#228;t Berlin that is exploring a completely new
publication model for linguistics books (<A HREF="http://hpsg.fu-berlin.de/OALI">http://hpsg.fu-berlin.de/OALI</A>),
with support from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG,
<A HREF="http://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/announcements_proposals/info_wissenschaft_13_70/">http://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/announcements_proposals/info_wissenschaft_13_70/</A>).
We aim to publish high-quality open-access books and want to be seen by
academic linguists as competitive with
the major international publishers. We believe that most of the
traditional services of book publishers are now done more efficiently by
science organizations themselves, and that it will be possible to
organize book publication in such a way that neither readers nor authors
are charged. This requires community involvement and the development of
certain technical skills, but we think that many linguists are willing
to support and adopt the new publication model.

The grant money will be used to develop a sustainable business model for
this publication unit and standards for LaTeX to ebook/XML conversion,
for setting up databases with linguistic examples that
are automatically extracted from our books and automatically annotated
for phenomena and languages.

The open source publishing software Open Monograph Press
(<A HREF="http://pkp.sfu.ca/omp/">http://pkp.sfu.ca/omp/</A>) will be extended by Open Review modules,
community reviewing and versioning and gamification aspects. Please
refer to the grant proposal for further details
(<A HREF="http://hpsg.fu-berlin.de/~stefan/Pub/lsp-dfg.html">http://hpsg.fu-berlin.de/~stefan/Pub/lsp-dfg.html</A>).


We are hiring four people with the following profiles:

- person 1
    knowledge of LaTeX and XML

    Required

      Knowledge of LaTeX and XML

    Bonus

      Knowledge of TEI
      Knowledge of automated conversion of word processor documents
      Knowledge of linguistics
      Knowledge of a scripting language
      Knowledge of versioning systems (svn, git)


- person 2
     knowledge of PHP and web programming in general

     Required
       PHP, Javascript, HTML, CSS, AJAX, git

     Bonus

      Knowledge of Open Monograph Press
      Knowledge of Scientific Publishing
      Knowledge of Social Software (Community Managment, Gamification)


- person 3
    knowledge of PHP

    Required

      PHP, Javascript, HTML, CSS, AJAX, git
      good communication skills
      Understandig for humanities

    Bonus

      Knowledge of Open Monograph Press
      multimedia and design expertise
      knowledge of legal and social aspects of German publishing

- person 4
    trained business economist

    Required
      MA in relevant area

    Bonus
      interest in new funding models for creative works in general
      (crowdfunding, micropayments)
      understanding of the roles of different actors in the publishing
      world


The positions can be announced as part-time and full-time positions.
The tasks are as follows:

Person 1 is responsible for converting LaTeX texts into XML and other
formats in particular ebook formats.

Person 2 is responsible for extensions of the Open Monograph Press
software. This involves an extension that allows to offer several
versions of a document and involve the scientifc community in
reviewing/proofreading of preofficial versions of the book. Part of this
task is the implementation of gamification aspects.

Person 3 will work at the CEDIS (<A HREF="http://www.cedis.fu-berlin.de/">http://www.cedis.fu-berlin.de/</A>) and is
responsible for hosting and for putting together OMP-Tutorials and
step-by-step tutorials for authors and editors. Person 3 will
also contribute to cusomization of OMP to aspects that are relevant for
OMP instances that are hosted in Germany (connection to VG-Wort, ...).

Person 4 is responsible to document all the financial aspects of our
project in order to find out the real costs of OA publishing. The DFG
wants us to develop a sustainable business model and the
business economist's task is to accompany this process.

Person 1-3 are expected to help with typesetting in case of shortage of
typesetting capacities.

Position 1 and 2 are fulltime positions, position 3 is part time from
50-75% and position 4 is 50%. It is also possible to give a Werkvertrag
(fixed sum, without employment) to the business economist. We are
flexible to a certain extent and it would be possible to combine the
business economist's position with other tasks of the press like
typesetting so that this position could be
extended to 75% or 100%.

All positions are paid according to the TVL 13 payscale
(<A HREF="http://oeffentlicher-dienst.info/c/t/rechner/tv-l/berlin?id=tv-l-berlin-2014">http://oeffentlicher-dienst.info/c/t/rechner/tv-l/berlin?id=tv-l-berlin-2014</A>).
The actual payment depends on the experience of the person who fills the
position.

Language Science Press is an equal rights enterprise, so applications by
women are explicitly encouraged.

Those who are interested, should contact Stefan M&#252;ller
(<A HREF="https://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-linguistics">Stefan.Mueller at fu-berlin.de</A>) as quickly as possible.
