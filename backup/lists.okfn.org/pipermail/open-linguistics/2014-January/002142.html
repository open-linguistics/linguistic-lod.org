==== Second Call for Posters ====
<A HREF="http://2014.eswc-conferences.org/important-dates/call-posters">http://2014.eswc-conferences.org/important-dates/call-posters</A>

11th Extended Semantic Web Conference (ESWC) 2014
Dates: May 25 - 29, 2014
Venue: Anissaras, Crete, Greece
Hashtag: #eswc2014
Feed: @eswc_conf
Site: <A HREF="http://2014.eswc-conferences.org">http://2014.eswc-conferences.org</A>
General Chair: Valentina Presutti (STLab, ISTC-CNR, IT)
Poster and Demo Chairs:
- Raphael Troncy (Multimedia Department, EURECOM, FR)
- Eva Blomqvist (Department of Computer and Information Science, Linkoping University, SE)

		
The poster track of ESWC 2014 will provide an opportunity for presenting late-breaking results, on-going research projects, and speculative or innovative work in progress. Posters are intended to provide authors and participants with the ability to connect with each other and to engage in discussions about the work.

We invite submissions relevant to the area of the Semantic Web that address, but are not limited to, the topics of the Research Track. Theoretical or technical posters, reports on semantic systems (however, demonstrations of such systems should be submitted in the demo track), descriptions of completed work, and work in progress are equally welcome.

Papers submitted to the research track will NOT automatically be considered for the poster track. A separate poster submission must be made. For example, a poster can be used to present work that was insufficiently mature for the research track.


* Submission Guidelines *

Authors must submit a 4-page paper (PDF, Springer LNCS style) with a short abstract for evaluation. The paper must clearly demonstrate relevance to the Semantic Web and the topics of interest of ESWC 2014. Decisions about acceptance will be based on relevance to the Semantic Web, originality, potential significance, topicality and clarity. Papers that exceed the given page length or do not follow the LNCS guidelines will be rejected without a review.

Submissions should be uploaded using the Easychair system:
	<A HREF="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eswc2014pd">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eswc2014pd</A>


* Important Dates *

Submission Deadline: March 16, 2014
Notification of Acceptance: April 10, 2014
Camera-Ready Paper: April 25, 2014


* Important Notes *

Poster papers will appear in supplementary post-conference proceedings to be published by Springer in the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS).

Participants with an accepted poster must register for the conference and present their work during the Poster Session. A space will be allocated for each participant. The organizers should be contacted well in advance of the conference in case of any special requirement.
