SEMANTiCS proceedings will be published by ACM ICP.

The Call for Industry Presentations at SEMANTiCS 2014 can be found here:
<A HREF="http://www.semantics.cc/open-calls/industry-presentations">http://www.semantics.cc/open-calls/industry-presentations</A>

The annual SEMANTiCS conference (formerly known as I-Semantics) is the meeting place for professionals who make semantic computing work, and understand its benefits and know its limitations. Every year, SEMANTiCS attracts information managers, IT-architects, software engineers, and researchers, from organisations ranging from NPOs, public administrations to the largest companies in the world. Attendees learn from industry experts and top researchers about emerging trends and topics in semantic software, enterprise data, linked data &amp; open data strategies and methodologies in knowledge modeling and text &amp; data analytics. The SEMANTiCS community is highly diverse; attendees have responsibilities interlinking areas like knowledge management, technical documentation, e-commerce, big data analytics, enterprise search, document management, business intelligence, and enterprise vocabulary management.

SEMANTiCS 2014 continues a long tradition of bringing together colleagues from around the world to present scientific papers, panels, posters, and best practices, to discuss semantic systems in birds-of-a-feather sessions and informal settings. SEMANTiCS addresses problems common among information managers, software engineers, IT-architects and various specialist departments working to develop, implement and/or evaluate semantic software systems.

The SEMANTiCS program is a rich mix of technical talks, panel discussions of important topics, and presentations by people who make things work - just like you. In addition, attendees can network with experts in a variety of fields. These relationships provide great value to organisations as they encounter subtle technical issues. The expertise gained by SEMANTiCS attendees has a long-term impact on their careers and organisations. These factors make SEMANTiCS the premiere event for our community.

The following horizontals (topics) and  verticals (industries) are mainly addressed:

Horizontals:
* Business Models, Governance &amp; Data Strategies
* Knowledge Discovery &amp; Intelligent Search
* Data Integration &amp; Enterprise Linked Data
* Big Data &amp; Text Analytics
* Data Portals &amp; Knowledge Visualisation
* Document Management &amp; Content Management
* Terminology, Thesaurus &amp; Ontology Management

Verticals:
* Industry &amp; Engineering
* Life Sciences &amp; Health Care
* Public Administration
* Galleries, Libraries, Archives &amp; Museums (GLAM)
* Media, Publishing &amp; Advertising
* Financial Industry
* Telecommunications
* Energy

Research / Application Papers

Papers report on novel scientific research and/or applications relevant to the topics of the conference. Submissions must be original and must not have been submitted for publication elsewhere. The number of pages of research papers is limited to 8 pages for full papers and 4 pages for short papers including references and an optional appendix.

All accepted full papers and short papers of SEMANTiCS will be published in the digital library of the ACM ICP Series under the ISBN-No.:
978-1-4503-1972-0. Full and short papers should follow the ACM ICPS guidelines for formatting
(<A HREF="http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates">http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates</A>) and must be submitted via the online submission system available at the conference website as PDF documents (other formats will not be accepted). For the camera-ready version, we will also need the source files (Latex, Word Perfect, Word).

Important Dates (Research &amp; Application)
* Abstract Submission Deadline:         May 23, 2014
* Paper Submission Deadline:            May 30, 2014
* Notification of Acceptance:           June 27, 2014

Posters &amp; Demos

The Posters &amp; Demonstrations Track offer an opportunity to present late-breaking research results, smaller contributions, and innovative work in progress.

The informal setting of the Posters &amp; Demonstrations Track encourages presenters and participants to engage in discussions about the presented work. Such discussions can be invaluable inputs for the future work of the presenters, while offering conference participants an effective way to broaden their knowledge of the emerging research trends and to network with other researchers. Poster and demo submissions should consist of a paper of 1-4 pages that describes the work and its contribution to the field. Submissions to Posters &amp; Demonstrations track must be formatted in the Springer LNCS format (<A HREF="http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs/lncs+authors">http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs/lncs+authors</A>), i.e. please do NOT use the ACM template here.

Submissions will be reviewed by experienced researchers and practitioners; each submission will receive detailed feedback.
