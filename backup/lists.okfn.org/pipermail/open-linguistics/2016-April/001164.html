**********************************************************************************

&#160;
AIMS:

&#160;

SLSP is a yearly conference series aimed at promoting and displaying excellent research on the wide spectrum of statistical methods that are currently in use in computational language or speech processing. It aims at attracting contributions from both fields. Though there exist large, well-known conferences and workshops hosting contributions to any of these areas, SLSP is a more focused meeting where synergies between subdomains and people will hopefully happen. In SLSP 2016, significant room will be reserved to young scholars at the beginning of their career and particular focus will be put on methodology.

&#160;
VENUE:

&#160;

SLSP 2016 will take place in Pilsen, nominated one of the two European Capitals of Culture in 2015. The venue will be the the&#160;NTIS research centre&#160;at the Faculty of Applied Sciences of the University of West Bohemia.

&#160;
SCOPE:

&#160;

The conference invites submissions discussing the employment of statistical models (including machine learning) within language and speech processing. Topics of either theoretical or applied interest include, but are not limited to:

&#160;

anaphora and coreference resolution

authorship identification, plagiarism and spam filtering

computer-aided translation

corpora and language resources

data mining and semantic web

information extraction

information retrieval

knowledge representation and ontologies

lexicons and dictionaries

machine translation

multimodal technologies

natural language understanding

neural representation of speech and language

opinion mining and sentiment analysis

parsing

part-of-speech tagging

question-answering systems

semantic role labelling

speaker identification and verification

speech and language generation

speech recognition
