As in the previous years, SEMANTiCS&#8217;16 proceedings are expected to be 
published by ACM ICP.

The annual SEMANTiCS conference is the meeting place for professionals 
who make semantic computing work, who understand its benefits and 
encounter its limitations. Every year, SEMANTiCS attracts information 
managers, IT-architects, software engineers and researchers from 
organisations ranging from NPOs, through public administrations to the 
largest companies in the world. Attendees learn from industry experts 
and top researchers about emerging trends and topics in the fields of 
semantic software, enterprise data, linked data &amp; open data strategies, 
methodologies in knowledge modelling and text &amp; data analytics. The 
SEMANTiCS community is highly diverse; attendees have responsibilities 
in interlinking areas like knowledge management, technical 
documentation, e-commerce, big data analytics, enterprise search, 
document management, business intelligence and enterprise vocabulary 
management.

The success of last year&#8217;s conference in Vienna with more than 280 
attendees from 22 countries proves that SEMANTiCS 2016 will continue a 
long tradition of bringing together colleagues from around the world. 
There will be presentations on industry implementations, use case 
prototypes, best practices, panels, papers and posters to discuss 
semantic systems in birds-of-a-feather sessions as well as informal 
settings. SEMANTICS addresses problems common among information 
managers, software engineers, IT-architects and various specialist 
departments working to develop, implement and/or evaluate semantic 
software systems.

The SEMANTiCS program is a rich mix of technical talks, panel 
discussions of important topics and presentations by people who make 
things work - just like you. In addition, attendees can network with 
experts in a variety of fields. These relationships provide great value 
to organisations as they encounter subtle technical issues in any stage 
of implementation. The expertise gained by SEMANTiCS attendees has a 
long-term impact on their careers and organisations. These factors make 
SEMANTiCS for our community the major industry related event across Europe.


SEMANTiCS 2016 will especially welcome submissions for the following hot 
topics:
* Data Quality Management
* Data Science (Data Mining, Machine Learning, Network Analytics)
* Semantics on the Web, Linked (Open) Data &amp; schema.org

Research / Innovation Papers
The Research &amp; Innovation track at SEMANTiCS welcomes the submission of 
papers on novel scientific research and/or innovations relevant to the 
topics of the conference. Submissions must be original and must not have 
been submitted for publication elsewhere. The Research &amp; Innovation 
track at SEMANTiCS is a single-blind review process (author names are 
visible to reviewers, reviewers stay anonymous). The submitted abstract 
and the topics are leveraged to find adequate reviewers for submitted 
papers. Please write an email to 
<A HREF="https://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-linguistics">semantics2016researchtrack at easychair.org</A>, if you have any questions.

Papers should follow the ACM ICPS guidelines for formatting and must not 
exceed 8 pages in length for full papers and 4 pages for short papers, 
including references and optional appendices. The layout templates can 
be found here: 
<A HREF="http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates">http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates</A> All accepted 
full papers and short papers will be published in the digital library of 
the ACM ICP Series. Research &amp; Innovation papers should be submitted 
through EasyChair at: 
<A HREF="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=semantics2016research.">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=semantics2016research.</A> Papers 
must be submitted in PDF (Adobe's Portable Document Format) format. 
Other formats will not be accepted. For the camera-ready version, the
