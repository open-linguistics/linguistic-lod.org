OF NATURAL COMPUTING

&#160;
TPNC 2016

&#160;
Sendai, Japan

&#160;
December 12-14, 2016

&#160;

Organized by:

***************************************************************************

&#160;
AIMS:

&#160;

TPNC is a conference series intending to cover the wide spectrum of computational principles, models and techniques inspired by information processing in nature. TPNC 2016 will reserve significant room for young scholars at the beginning of their career and particular focus will be put on methodology. The conference aims at attracting contributions to nature-inspired models of computation, synthesizing nature by means of computation, nature-inspired materials, and information processing in nature.

&#160;
VENUE:

&#160;

TPNC 2016 will take place in Sendai, in the northeast (Tohoku) region of Japan. The city was founded in 1600 and is nicknamed the &quot;city of trees&quot;. It is the second largest city north of Tokyo. It takes about 100 minutes to reach Sendai from Tokyo by bullet train (Shinkansen). The venue will be the Cyberscience Center, Aobayama Campus, Tohoku University:
