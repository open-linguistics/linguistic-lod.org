==== Final Call for Workshops ====
<A HREF="http://2014.eswc-conferences.org/important-dates/call-workshops">http://2014.eswc-conferences.org/important-dates/call-workshops</A>

The organizers of the 11th ESWC 2014 cordially invite you to submit a workshop proposal. ESWC is a major venue for discussing the latest scientific results and innovations in the field of semantic technologies on the Web and Linked Data, attracting a high number of high quality submissions and participants from academia and industry alike.

Co-located workshops at ESWC conferences are distinguished meeting points for discussing ongoing work and latest ideas related to semantic technologies and the Semantic Web. Of particular interest are workshop proposals with an interdisciplinary standpoint, proposals focusing on a specific technology of general interest, or gathering a sub-community. We encourage the submission of workshop proposals on:
 
* Fundamental problems of the Semantic Web / Linked Data such as ontology mining, heterogeneity, scalability and distribution, uncertainty, etc.
* Applications of Semantic Web technologies in specific domains,
* Important enabling technologies and their adaptation to the needs of the Semantic Web, and
* Aspects of Semantic Web research that have been neglected so far, 
* Techniques from other research fields that are of relevance for Semantic Web research (e.g., machine learning, NLP, data mining)



# General Information and Criteria 

Each proposal will be reviewed by the members of the workshop programme committee, and ranked based on the overall quality of the proposal and the workshop's fit to the conference as detailed below. Their recommendation will determine the final decision on the acceptance/rejection of each proposal, which is to be taken by the workshop and tutorial chairs as well as by the local and the general chair of ESWC 2014.
 
The criteria for judging the quality of workshop proposals are as follows:
 
* Co-located workshops cover topics falling in the general scope of the ESWC conference.
* Workshops are intended to be genuine interactive events and not mini-conferences.
* We welcome workshops with creative structures and organizations that attract various types of contributions and ensure rich interactions.
* Workshops should have a clear focus on a specific technology, problem or application.
* There is potentially a significant community interested in the workshop's topic.
* Workshop duration can be half a day or a full day.
* We strongly advise having more than one organizer and no more than four, preferably from different institutions, bringing different perspectives to the workshop topic.
 
In case overlapping workshops are proposed, the workshop chair may contact the organisers to discuss the possibility of merging workshops. Please note that the duration of a workshop might need to be adjusted based on the overall number of submissions received. Further, workshops that receive less than 5 submissions or have less than 10 people registered at the early registration deadline might be canceled.
 
The organizers of accepted workshops will be responsible for their own reviewing process, publicity (e.g., website, timelines and call for papers), and proceedings production. They will be required to closely cooperate with the Workshop Chair and the ESWC 2014 local organizers to finalize all organizational details. Workshop attendees must pay the ESWC 2014 workshop registration fee, as well as the conference registration fee.

Organizers of workshops and tutorials will get a free registration for workshops and tutorials at the pre-conference days, i.e. they will only have to pay the main conference fee.

# Submission Guidelines 

Workshop proposals have to be submitted via Easychair at <A HREF="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eswc2014workshops-tutorials.">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eswc2014workshops-tutorials.</A> Each proposal must consist of a single PDF document written in English, not longer than 3 pages, which contains the following information:
 
1. The title and brief technical description of the workshop, specifying its goals and motivation.
2. A brief discussion of why the topic is of particular interest at this time.
3. A brief description of why and to whom the workshop is of interest, the workshop audience, as well as the expected number of participants.
4. A brief description (draft outline) of the proposed workshop format, discussing the mix of events and activities such as paper presentations, invited talks, panels, hacking session, or general discussion, and and an approximate timeline.
5. A list of (potential) members of the program committee (at least 50% have to be known and confirmed at the time of the proposal).
6. An indication of whether the workshop should be considered for a half-day or full-day event.
7. Related Workshops and Conferences: Is this the continuation of a workshop series or a new workshop to address an emerging issue? Please provide information about past versions of this workshop and other related workshops (including URLs and submission/acceptance counts, if available).
8. Names and contact information of the workshop organizers/chair(s) (name, affiliation, email address, homepage and short (one paragraph) biography of each chair, explaining the chair's expertise for the workshop including past experience in organizing/facilitating workshops). Preferably a single contact person per submission.

The best papers of each workshop will be included in the supplementary proceedings of ESWC 2014, which will appear in the Springer LNCS series.
