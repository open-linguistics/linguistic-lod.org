****************************************************************************************


The 4th International Conference on the Theory and Practice of
Natural Computing (TPNC 2015) invites authors to submit poster
presentations. TPNC 2015 will be held in Mieres (Spain) on 15-16
December, 2015. See 

<A HREF="http://grammars.grlmc.com/tpnc2015/">http://grammars.grlmc.com/tpnc2015/</A> 

Poster
presentations are intended to enhance informal interactions with the
conference participants, at the same time allowing for in-depth
discussion. 

TOPICS 

Authors are encouraged to submit presentations
displaying novel work in progress on: 

- nature-inspired models of
computation, 

- synthesizing nature by means of computation, 

-
nature-inspired materials, 

- information processing in nature, 

-
applications of natural computing. 

Posters do not need to show final
research results. Work that might lead to new interesting developments
is welcome. 

KEY DATES 

Submission deadline: November 8, 2015


Notification of poster acceptance or rejection: November 15, 2015


SUBMISSION 

Please submit a .pdf abstract through:


<A HREF="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tpnc2015">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tpnc2015</A> 

It should
contain the title, author(s) and affiliation, and should not exceed 500
words. 

PRESENTATION 

Posters will be allocated 10 minutes each in the
programme for oral presentation. Moreover, they will remain hanging out
during the whole conference for discussion. 

PUBLICATION 

Posters will
not appear in the LNCS proceedings volume of TPNC 2015. However, they
will be eligible for submission to the post-conference journal special
issue in Soft Computing (Springer). 

REGISTRATION 

At least one author
of each accepted poster must register to the conference. Their
registration fare is reduced: 225 Euro (appr. half of the cheapest fare
for regular participants). Contributors of regular papers who in
addition get a poster accepted must register for the latter too.
