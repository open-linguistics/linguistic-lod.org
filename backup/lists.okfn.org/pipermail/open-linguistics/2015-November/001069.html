2ND
INTERNATIONAL WINTER SCHOOL ON BIG DATA 

&#160; 

BIGDAT 2016 

BILBAO,
SPAIN 

FEBRUARY 8-12, 2016 

Organized by: 

DeustoTech, University of
Deusto 

Rovira i VirgiliUniversity


<A HREF="http://grammars.grlmc.com/bigdat2016/">http://grammars.grlmc.com/bigdat2016/</A>


******************************************************** 

--- Early
registration deadline: November 15, 2015 ---


******************************************************** 

AIM:


BigDat 2016 will be a research training event addressed to graduates
and postgraduates in the first steps of their academic career. With a
global scope, it aims at updating them about the most recent advances in
the critical and fast developing area of big data, which covers a large
spectrum of current exciting research and industrial innovation with an
extraordinary potential for a huge impact on scientific discoveries,
medicine, engineering, business models, and society itself. Renowned
academics and industry pioneers will lecture and share their views with
the audience. 

Most big data subareas will be displayed, namely:
foundations, infrastructure, management, search and mining, security and
privacy, and applications. Main challenges of analytics, management and
storage of big data will be identified through 4 keynote lectures, 20
six-hour courses, and 1 round table, which will tackle the most active
and promising topics. The organizers are convinced that outstanding
speakers will attract the brightest and most motivated students.
Interaction will be a main component of the event. An open session will
give participants the opportunity to present their own work in progress
in 5 minutes. 

ADDRESSED TO: 

Graduates and postgraduates from around
the world. There are no formal pre-requisites in terms of academic
degrees. However, since there will be differences in the course levels,
specific knowledge background may be assumed for some of them. BigDat
2016 is also appropriate for more senior people who want to keep
themselves updated on recent developments and future trends. All will
surely find it fruitful to listen and discuss with major researchers,
industry leaders and innovators. 

REGIME: 

In addition to keynotes,
2-3 courses will run in parallel during the whole event. Participants
will be able to freely choose the courses they will be willing to attend
as well as to move from one to another. 

VENUE: 

BigDat 2016 will take
place in Bilbao, the capital of the Basque Country region, famous for
its gastronomy and the seat of the GuggenheimMuseum. The venue will be:


DeustoTech, School of Engineering

<A HREF="http://grammars.grlmc.com/bigdat2016/registration.php">http://grammars.grlmc.com/bigdat2016/registration.php</A> 

The selection
of up to 8 courses requested in the registration template is only
tentative and non-binding. For the sake of organization, it will be
helpful to have an approximation of the respective demand for each
course. 

Since the capacity of the venue is limited, registration
requests will be processed on a first come first served basis. The
registration period will be closed and the on-line registration facility
disabled when the capacity of the venue will be complete. It is much
recommended to register prior to the event. 

FEES: 

Participants are
expected to attend full-time. Fees are a flat rate allowing the
attendance to all courses during the week. There are several early
registration deadlines. Fees depend on the registration deadline.


ACCOMMODATION: 

Suggestions of accommodation are available on the
webpage. 

CERTIFICATE: 

Participants will be delivered a certificate
of attendance.
