<PRE>Apologies for cross-posting
---------------------------

The MDPI Information Journal invites submissions to a special issue on
&#8220;Towards the Multilingual Web of Data&#8221; and the deadline has been extended
to the *31st January 2018.*

<A HREF="http://www.mdpi.com/journal/information/special_issues/Web_Data">http://www.mdpi.com/journal/information/special_issues/Web_Data</A>

The Web of Data has increasingly become a space where concepts are
described not only with logic and ontologies but also with linguistic
information in the form of multilingual lexicons, terminologies and
thesauri. In particular, this has lead to the creation of a growing cloud
of linguistic linked open data, which bridges the world of ontologies with
dictionaries, corpora and other linguistic resources. This raises several
challenges such as ontology localisation, cross-lingual question answering,
cross-lingual ontology and data matching, representation of lexical
information on the Web of Data, etc.

Furthermore, NLP and machine learning for linked data can benefit from
exploiting multilingual language resources such as annotated corpora,
wordnets, bilingual dictionaries, etc. if they are themselves formally
represented and linked by following the linked data principles. A critical
mass of language resources as linked data on the Web is leading to a new
generation of linked data-aware NLP techniques and tools which, in turn,
will serve as basis for a richer, multilingual Web.

This special issue is concerned with groundbreaking topics at the interface
of the Semantic Web, language resources and NLP, with particular emphasis
on multilingual aspects.

Topics of call
* Linguistic Linked Open Data
* NLP on the Semantic Web
* Multilinguality and semantics
* Best practices for multilingual linked data
* Validation, quality and legal issues for multilingual linked data
* Language resources published as linked data
* Ontologies, terminologies and models for multilingual linked data
* Publishing language resources as linked data using language description
models such as OntoLex-lemon
* Cross-lingual information access, search and retrieval
* NLP and machine learning approaches for the Semantic Web and Linked Data
* Applications using Linguistic Linked Data resources such as DBpedia,
WordNet or BabelNet

Papers&#8217; length should be 9-15 pages and formatted according to the
MDPI template.
