Workshop Description

The increasing availability of knowledge bases, generated by researchers 
in the academia and industry, enables extensions of NLP applications 
with the vast amount of background knowledge available in open formats. 
However, most of the information that we find in knowledge bases, like 
knowledge graphs, ontologies, taxonomies, thesauri, dictionaries or 
terminological datasets, contain descriptions in natural language, 
mostly only in English, which severely limits their exploitation. 
Machine translation (MT) can be applied to automatically translate the 
terminological expressionsinto multiple languages, but not without its 
challenges. Usually, they contain domain-specific terminology, which is 
notoriously difficult to deal with since it is underrepresented in the 
MT training data.


On the other hand, growing attention has also been paid to the 
integration of domain-specific knowledge into MT systems or CAT tools. 
To reduce the post-editing effort involved in the translation process, 
approaches that enhance the MT systems with existing 
multilingualdomain-specific knowledge, (e.g. DBpedia, IATE or ETB) are 
becoming increasingly popular. In this sense, the provision of 
multilingual knowledge bases that could be integrated better into the MT 
pipeline is a crucial step towards increasing the translation quality of 
highly-specific texts.

We believe that in the same way that domain ontologies and terminologies 
can benefit from NLP tools and MT systems that help to overcome the 
language barrier, NLP tools and MT systems would also profit from the 
specialized semantic knowledge and the terms that are captured in 
multilingual ontologies or terminologies. The workshop, therefore, aims 
at building a bridge between the knowledge base and machine translation 
communities.


Objective

This workshop aims to offer a forum for discussions to researchers who 
find themselves at the intersection of the two strands of research, 
namely, knowledge representations of high-specialized domains 
(represented by domain ontologies, terminologies, dictionaries) and MT, 
where the intersection point is precisely multilingualism. On the one 
hand, there is an impending need to cater for multilingual knowledge 
resources that support NLP, content analytics or information extraction 
across languages. On the other hand, there is a growing interest in 
exploiting the knowledge captured in such resources for MT systems that 
often lack the knowledge of domain-specific expressions.


We would like to bring together researchers from different communities 
as well as other interested stakeholders from the industry and the 
public sector in order to identify common interests, exploit synergies, 
provide use cases, and share methods, tools and resources. We are 
particularly interested to bring together researchers and practitioners 
working on MT, specifically statistical (SMT) or neural (NMT), on the 
one hand and experts on knowledge basesfrom various perspectives on the 
other, in order to enable cross fertilisation and foster the creation of 
innovative solutions that can only arise from interdisciplinary 
collaborations.


Topics of Interest

The workshop invites the submission of papers reporting on research on 
topics related to terminological/ontological resources processing in MT, 
including, but not limited to:

  *

    Multilingual knowledge base generation with MT

  *

    Injection of multilingual knowledge into MT

  *

    Provenance of multiple multilingual resources for MT

  *

    Terminological variations and MT

  *

    MT used for cross-lingual information access, search and retrieval

  *

    Neural MT applied to terminology translation

  *

    Exploiting relational knowledge graphs for Neural MT

  *

    Morphological variations of terminological expressions in MT

  *

    Multilingual knowledge generation for under-resourced languages

  *

    Enriching MT with Linked Data (BabelNet, DBpedia, UMLS, ...)

  *

    Multilingual terminology and linguistic resource development,
    integration and mapping in a Linked Data context

  *

    Multilingual Semantic Web and Linked Data use cases


Submission &amp; Publication

We accept submission of both long (up to 8 pages) and short papers (up 
to 4 pages) to be presented as long or short oral presentations at the 
workshop. The papers of the workshop will be published as online 
proceedings on the LREC 2018 website. Please check the LREC author&#8217;s kit 
website &lt;<A HREF="http://lrec2018.lrec-conf.org/en/submission/authors-kit/">http://lrec2018.lrec-conf.org/en/submission/authors-kit/</A>&gt;for 
the proceedings template.


In addition, we aim for a journal special issue as post-conference 
proceedings in which a selected amount of papers presented at the 
workshop will be published.


When submitting a paper from the START page 
&lt;<A HREF="https://www.softconf.com/lrec2018/MomenT/">https://www.softconf.com/lrec2018/MomenT/</A>&gt;, authors will be asked to 
provide essential information about resources (in a broad sense, i.e. 
also technologies, standards, evaluation kits, etc.) that have been used 
for the work described in the paper or are a new result of your research.


For contact data, stylesheets, up-to-date details on submission and the 
workshop itself, please consult the workshop website 
(<A HREF="http://moment2018.insight-centre.org/">http://moment2018.insight-centre.org/</A>).


Identify, Describe and Share your LRs!

Describing your LRs in the LRE Map is now a normal practice in the 
submission procedure of LREC (introduced in 2010 and adopted by other 
conferences). To continue the efforts initiated at LREC 2014 about 
&#8220;Sharing LRs&#8221; (data, tools, web-services, etc.), authors will have the 
possibility, &#160;when submitting a paper, to upload LRs in a special LREC 
repository. &#160;This effort of sharing LRs, linked to the LRE Map for their 
description, may become a new &#8220;regular&#8221; feature for conferences in our 
field, thus contributing to creating a common repository where everyone 
can deposit and share data.


As scientific work requires accurate citations of referenced work so as 
to allow the community to understand the whole context and also 
replicate the experiments conducted by other researchers, LREC 2018 
endorses the need to uniquely Identify LRs through the use of the 
International Standard Language Resource Number (ISLRN,www.islrn.org 
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.islrn.org">http://www.islrn.org</A>&gt;), a Persistent Unique Identifier to be assigned 
to each Language Resource. The assignment of ISLRNs to LRs cited in LREC 
papers &#160;will be offered at submission time.
