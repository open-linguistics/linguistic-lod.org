<PRE>1st WORKSHOP ON LANGUAGE RESOURCES AND TECHNOLOGIES
     FOR THE LEGAL KNOWLEDGE GRAPH

12 May 2018, Miyazaki, Japan

Call for Papers

<A HREF="http://legalkg.lynx-project.eu">http://legalkg.lynx-project.eu</A>

Co-located with LREC 2018, 7-12 May 2018, Miyazaki, Japan

The World Wide Web and also Internet-based applications as well as startup
companies are diversifying with an astonishing pace. While, only a few years
ago, general-purpose applications and companies with a rather broad 
scope have
been ubiquitous, now more and more niches and highly specific domains are
being explored, both by academic and industrial research and also by
enterprises and entrepreneurs. One of the specific domains that has been
receiving a lot of attention recently are legal and regulatory information
systems, among others, with regard to cross-border commerce, for example,
within the European Union&#8217;s Digital Single Market but also in other 
areas and
regions.

Of special interest in that regard is the recent hype around &#8220;regtech&#8221; 
(i.e.,
applying technologies to regulatory applications), the use of cognitive
computing and language technologies to tackle the law (especially regarding
the extraction of structured information from legal documents) and the
adoption of semantic technologies for publishing legislative documents 
by the
European institutions demonstrates that the next generation of intelligent
applications is appearing in the legal domain.

These applications rely extensively on text resources and semantic web
technologies. There is also a strong demand for high-quality, well described
language resources, which can be used in the legal domain. Vast amounts of
cases, rulings, laws, regulations, political programs, parliamentary debates
and public opinions have been released in the last few years. However, we
still don&#8217;t have a clear consensus or agreement of what the key
characteristics, components and functionalities of the Legal Knowledge Graph
should be. The language resources that should be used to populate the Legal
Knowledge Graph are also a topic of current debates.

The proposed workshop is aimed at filling this crucial gap. In order to
develop new products and services to assist lawyers and experts in the legal
domain, a new type of interoperable language resources and technologies is
necessary, aimed specifically at constructing the Legal Knowledge Graph.

The 1st Legal KG Workshop invites research in language resources and
technologies for the Legal Knowledge Graph, including but not limited to:

&#8226;    Resources in the legal domain such as: legislation, treaties, 
regulations,
     court decisions, case law (judgments, orders), international 
agreements or
     perparatory acts (legislative proposals, reports, etc.)
&#8226;    Resources in the political domain, e.g., political programs,
     parliament debates, etc.
&#8226;    Resources from the private law, such as contracts, agreements, etc.
&#8226;    Legal ontologies, vocabularies and thesauri
&#8226;    Technologies for handling resources in multiples languages from
     multiple jurisdictions
&#8226;    Localization of legal documents
&#8226;    Patterns in language and law
&#8226;    Automatic regulatory compliance systems
&#8226;    Applications of AI in the legal domain based on language resources
&#8226;    Legal text mining systems
&#8226;    Translation of legal documents
&#8226;    Methods of alignment of legislation with company workflows,
     public opinion, etc.
&#8226;    Any other research useful towards the Legal Knowledge Graph

The proceedings of the workshop will be published on the LREC 2018 website.

SUBMISSIONS

The submission process will be organised using the START Conference

IDENTIFY, DESCRIBE AND SHARE YOUR LRs!

Describing your LRs in the LRE Map is now a normal practice in the 
submission
procedure of LREC (introduced in 2010 and adopted by other conferences). To
continue the efforts initiated at LREC 2014 about &#8220;Sharing LRs&#8221; (data, 
tools,
web-services, etc.), authors will have the possibility, when submitting a
paper, to upload LRs in a special LREC repository. This effort of 
sharing LRs,
linked to the LRE Map for their description, may become a new &#8220;regular&#8221;
feature for conferences in our field, thus contributing to creating a common
repository where everyone can deposit and share data.

As scientific work requires accurate citations of referenced work so as to
allow the community to understand the whole context and also replicate the
experiments conducted by other researchers, LREC 2018 endorses the need to
uniquely Identify LRs through the use of the International Standard Language
Resource Number (ISLRN, www.islrn.org), a Persistent Unique Identifier to be
assigned to each Language Resource. The assignment of ISLRNs to LRs cited in
LREC papers will be offered at submission time.
