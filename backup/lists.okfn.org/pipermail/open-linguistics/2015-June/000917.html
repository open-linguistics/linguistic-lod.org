--------------------
SEMANTiCS Conference
--------------------

The annual SEMANTiCS conference is the meeting place for professionals who make semantic computing work, who understand its benefits and encounter its limitations. Every year, SEMANTiCS attracts information managers, IT-architects, software engineers and researchers from organisations ranging from NPOs, through public administrations to the largest companies in the world. Attendees learn from industry experts and top researchers about emerging trends and topics in the fields of semantic software, enterprise data, linked data &amp; open data strategies, methodologies in knowledge modelling and text &amp; data analytics. The SEMANTiCS community is highly diverse; attendees have responsibilities in areas like knowledge management, technical documentation, e-commerce, big data analytics, enterprise search, document management, business intelligence and enterprise vocabulary management.

The success of last year&#8217;s conference in Leipzig with more than 230 attendees from 22 countries proves that SEMANTiCS 2015 will continue a long tradition of bringing together colleagues from around the world. There will be presentations on industry implementations, use case prototypes, best practices, panels, papers and posters to discuss semantic systems in birds-of-a-feather sessions as well as informal settings. SEMANTICS addresses problems common among information managers, software engineers, IT-architects and various specialist departments working to develop, implement and/or evaluate semantic software systems.

The SEMANTiCS program is a rich mix of technical talks, panel discussions of important topics and presentations by people who make things work - just like you. In addition, attendees can network with experts in a variety of fields. These relationships provide great value to organisations as they encounter subtle technical issues in any stage of implementation. The expertise gained by SEMANTiCS attendees has a long-term impact on their careers and organisations. These factors make SEMANTiCS for our community the major industry related event across Europe.
Posters &amp; Demos Track

--------------------------------
Posters and Demonstrations Track
--------------------------------

The Posters &amp; Demonstrations Track invites innovative work in progress, late-breaking research and innovation results, and smaller contributions in all fields related to the broadly understood Semantic Web. The informal setting of the Posters &amp; Demonstrations Track encourages participants to present innovations to the research community, business users and find new partners or clients.  In addition to the business stream, SEMANTiCS 2015 welcomes developer-oriented posters and demos to the new technical stream.

The business stream encourages submissions on innovative applications with impact on end users. These include various demos of solutions that users may test or that are yet in the conceptual phase, but are worth discussing. This stream is to encourage feedback, target potential users or establish new partnerships. Such discussions can be invaluable inputs for the future work of the presenters, while offering conference participants an effective way to broaden their knowledge on the emerging research trends and to network with other researchers. There is no limitation regarding horizontal or vertical domains of the solutions.
The technical stream focuses on applications or pieces of code that may attract developers and potential research or business partners. Developers are invited to share libraries or various components they created and that may be applied in various applications for diverse domains.

Poster and demo submissions should consist of a paper of 1-4 pages that describe the work, its contribution to the field or novelty aspects. Submissions will be reviewed by experienced and knowledgeable researchers and practitioners; each submission will receive a detailed feedback. For demos, it would be beneficial to include also links enabling the reviewers testing the application or reviewing the component.

The 25 best posters (5-6 papers) will be published in the digital library of the ACM ICP Series.
All papers should follow the ACM ICPS guidelines for formatting (<A HREF="http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates">http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates</A>) and must be submitted via Easychair as PDF documents (other formats will not be accepted). For the camera-ready version of these papers, we will also need the source files (Latex, Word). The other papers will be published in the <A HREF="http://ceur-ws.org/.">http://ceur-ws.org/.</A>
