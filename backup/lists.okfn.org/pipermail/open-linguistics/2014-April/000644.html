5th Workshop on Business and IT Alignment (BITA 2014)
<A HREF="http://bis.kie.ue.poznan.pl/17th_bis/wscfp.php?ws=bita2014">http://bis.kie.ue.poznan.pl/17th_bis/wscfp.php?ws=bita2014</A>

A contemporary challenge for enterprises is to keep up with the pace of changing business demands imposed on them in different ways. There is today an obvious demand for continuous improvement and alignment in enterprises but unfortunately many organisations don&#146;t have proper instruments (methods, patterns, best practices etc.) to achieve this. Enterprise modelling and business process management are two areas belonging to a tradition where the mission is to improve business practice and business and IT alignment. In this tradition the alignment process usually is manifested in taking a business from one state (AS-IS) into another improved state (TO-BE), i.e. a transformation of the business and its supporting IT into something that is regarded as better. A challenge in business and IT alignment is to move beyond a narrow focus on one tradition or technology. There is a need to aware of and able to deal with a number of dimensions of the enterprise architecture and their rela
 tions in order to create alignment. Examples of such dimensions are: organisational structures, strategies, business models, work practices, processes, and IS/IT structures. Among the concepts that deserve special attention in this context is IT governance. Effective IT governance aligns IT investments with overall business priorities, determines who makes the IT decisions and assigns accountability for the outcomes.

This workshop aims to bring together people who have strong interest in business and IT alignment. We would like to invite researchers and practitioners from both industry and academia to submit original results of their completed or ongoing projects. We encourage broad understanding of possible approaches and solutions for business and IT alignment, including IT governance subjects. Specific focus will be on practices of business and IT alignment, i.e. we encourage submission of case study and experience papers.

Topics
    Challenges in business and IT alignment
    Business and IT alignment in small and medium sized enterprises
    Business/ IT alignment through BPM
    Business and IT alignment discovery, change and improvement - methodologies and best practices
    Business value of business and IT alignment
    Organisational implementations of various levels of business and IT alignment approaches
    Metrics associated with the alignment life cycle, re-design, implementation, management and improvement
    Best practice business and IT alignment case studies
    The relationship between BPM and enterprise architecture
    Critical success factors and associated KPIs&#180; for alignment initiatives
    IT governance as a mean for alignment
    Enterprise modelling as a tool for business and IT alignment
    Human aspects of business and IT alignment; organizational staffing and structure, change management and leadership strategies

During the last few years, the growing interest and popularity in crypto currencies have fostered developments in research and practices in relevant fields. Academics and practitioners, alike, are facing challenges related to the ever increasing required infrastructure for mining crypro-currencies, the operational aspects of exchanges, the regulatory frameworks that are required for the new form of payment instruments without hindering the growth of the new economy and the relation between crypto-currencies and official payment methods.

Nowadays, addressing such challenges becomes essential for developing new services and possibly business models that contain the prospect of restructuring financial systems.

This workshop invites researchers and business experts to share knowledge and competencies for organizational and practical apsects of crypto-currency systems. We expect participants to present research papers, comment on business cases, hold tutorial sessions or demonstrate systems, tools and other related issues needed to:

1st Workshop on Tools for Setting Up and Running a Business in Cloud Computing (TSRB 2014)
<A HREF="http://bis.kie.ue.poznan.pl/17th_bis/wscfp.php?ws=tsrb2014">http://bis.kie.ue.poznan.pl/17th_bis/wscfp.php?ws=tsrb2014</A>

During the last decade technology evolved in a way that resulted in huge amount of data. This evolvement imposed on enterprises, the need to automate their core processes for operational excellence while spending huge amount of money to acquire the infrastructure and the tools to do so. The data repositories developed, provided the means to accrue the significant benefit of leveraging the value hidden in information accumulated during business transactions over time to support decision making and improve performance implying additional investments for the companies.

Nowadays, this need becomes crucial for the survival of enterprises since competition becomes more aggressive, profit margins are limited, market becomes more demanding and customers seek experience of high quality and value. Even though, the cost of such infrastructures has been significantly reduced, the economic crisis limited the business budgets (especially for small and medium enterprises) in ways that could not afford setting up high performance infrastructures.

The concept of cloud computing provides the solution to address the problem of high cost by providing infrastructures that accommodate the tools needed for setting up and running a business.

This workshop invites researchers and business experts to share knowledge by introducing innovative tools for setting up and running a business in cloud computing. We expect practitioners to demonstrate business case tutorials that will introduce the sophisticated technologies and skills needed to capture transactions and process business data: (a) to operate business and (b) to find patterns and relationships from past transactions to make decisions and to improve an organization&#146;s performance and decision making ability.

Topics
    Cloud Computing: Solutions and Best Practices
    In-memory Computing and Big Data
    Business Suites and Underline Architectures
    Advanced Management Solutions: Financials, HR, Sales, Procurement, Billing, Order Management, etc.
    Advanced Knowledge-Based Business Information Systems
    Decision Support Systems in Business
    Enterprise Resource Planning
    Customer Relationship Management
    Supplier Relationship Management
    Business Intelligence
    Data Mining In Business
    Facility Management
    Customer Experience Management
    Campaign Management
    Marketing
    Developing innovative products and services (basket analysis)
    Business Discovery
    Social Media

Very Large Business Applications (VLBA) act as enabler for intra- and interorganisational business processes and play a significant role in the development of new business models. With a special focus on related operations management this workshop aims at studying, grounding, and finally exploiting the potential of VLBA to solve integration and coordination problems in distributed business processes as a key enabler of flexible, boundaryless information systems.

Key research questions are:
- how to represent VLBA in service-based information systems by employing and adapting constructs, models, and methods of different information systems technology stacks,
- how to coordinate software services by employing and adapting approaches for service discovery and composition,
- how to operate large-scale, highly distributed enterprise systems aligned with the needs of an agile business environment,
- how to negotiate and agree upon the delivery of software-based services (SLA),
- how to control the delivery of software-based services in VLBA by measuring efficiency and effectiveness.
