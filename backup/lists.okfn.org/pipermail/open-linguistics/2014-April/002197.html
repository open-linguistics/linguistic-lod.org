11th Extended Semantic Web Conference (ESWC) 2014
Dates: May 25 - 29, 2014
Venue: Anissaras, Crete, Greece
Hashtag: #eswc2014
Feed: @eswc_conf
Site: <A HREF="http://2014.eswc-conferences.org">http://2014.eswc-conferences.org</A>
General Chair: Valentina Presutti (STLab, ISTC-CNR, IT)

We are pleased to announce that ESWC will distribute a total budget of 4,000 Eur among full-time students for supporting their participation in ESWC 2014. 
All full-time students are eligible to participate in the selection. 
The number of awards will be limited, and the amount of each award will depend on the number of participants and will be provided in the form of reduced registration fee. 

In order to apply, please be sure to execute all the following actions:
- register at [1] by choosing the Student Participation Fee by *** April 20th *** (skip the payment step) 
- send an email to <A HREF="https://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-linguistics">eswc2014 at youvivo.com</A> by *** April 20th *** acknowledging your registration and providing your details (name and affiliation) 
- have your advisor email by *** April 30th *** a recommendation to <A HREF="https://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-linguistics">eswc2014-pc-chairs at lists.sti2.org</A> in which he/she states support for your application, confirms your status as a full-time student and indicates your possible authorship or co-authorship of a paper accepted in any of the ESWC 2014 tracks

To receive full consideration, both registration and advisor letters must be received by the indicated deadlines.

If you have already registered and payed you are still eligible to participate in the selection. You will have to perform the last two steps, and in case you will be selected, you will be reimbursed of the amount of the award.

Notifications will be sent by May 9th, 2014.
