<PRE>Dear colleagues,

we were working hard since the relocation from Michigan to Indiana on a 
new version of LL-Map (or LINGUIST List Map). It took us more than two 
years to save the maps and rebuild a new interface to access them.

We had to save the data that was created over years at LINGUIST List, 
set up new technologies, GIS servers, web server, map editors, manually 
transform the maps and data to fit the new technology standards, and 
literally work through every single map to save it, to make it 
compatible with new GIS software.

We are proud that the data is back up again. We are grateful to all 
people who were involved and helped us making this possible, our 
graduate assistants at LINGUIST List, Lwin Moe, our tech-person, and all 
interns who participated in the LINGUIST List summer activities in 2015 
and 2016: Jacob Henry, Jacob Heredos, Chloe Chen, Noah Kaufman.

LL-Map (Beta):
<A HREF="http://llmap.org/">http://llmap.org/</A>

See the list of maps:
<A HREF="http://llmap.org/map/">http://llmap.org/map/</A>

Or a map of dialects of Western Russia:
<A HREF="http://llmap.org/map/214883/">http://llmap.org/map/214883/</A>

We would be happy to link these maps to other language data and provide 
new types of interfaces. Let us know, if you have ideas or suggestions, 
how we could integrate this into the larger LLOD-project.

You will find maps from all regions of the world on LL-Map, the source 
and bibliographic reference, where the maps are taken from, and the 
digital scan of the original book page showing the map.

The interface is not ready yet, it is not perfect, but it is usable. 
Zooming in and out on the map image works with scrolling the mouse up 
and down, or pinching around on tablets or other mobile devices etc. It 
is actually really usable on tablets or mobile phones. We will be 
working on improvements of the interface. Currently it is using 
JavaScript, the Django framework, an OpenGIS in the backend, etc.

You can add your own maps to this system. We can show you how you can 
contribute.


Sincerely
Malgosia Cavar and Damir Cavar
