Call for Papers: Workshop on the Use of Multilingual Language Resources in Knowledge Representation Systems

Date: 10 July 2015
Location: Vienna, Austria
Venue: Centre for Translation Studies of the University of Vienna
Website: <A HREF="http://www.dfki.de/mlkrep/">http://www.dfki.de/mlkrep/</A>

A workshop affiliated with the 20th European Symposium on Languages for Special Purposes (LSP 2015, <A HREF="https://lsp2015.univie.ac.at/">https://lsp2015.univie.ac.at/</A>) from 8-10 July 2015.

Paper submission deadline: 30 March 2015

AIMS AND SCOPE

Nowadays the Web is fundamental to any type of professional communication. More and more specialized content is provided in languages other than English. Professional and specialized communication relies on knowledge management systems and language resources, that is, collections of natural language data, such as terminologies, lexicons, corpora, NLP resources, annotation schemes and standards. To meet the challenges of inter- and intra-organizational processes and demands of internationalization, knowledge representation needs to be multilingual and accessible across systems and platforms.

The language industry has successfully developed and deployed tools and resources for multilingual content, such as localization and translation management resources, but its support to knowledge engineering has not yet been sufficiently explored. Multilingual knowledge representation based on web technologies using the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and the Web Ontology Language (OWL) is an open research area calling for interdisciplinary approaches for creating, managing, and using information on the Web.

The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners from various disciplines interested in multilingual knowledge representation and discuss possibilities of leveraging mutual benefits of language and knowledge representation resources. This includes but is not limited to knowledge engineering, terminology engineering, ontology-based systems, lexicographic approaches, computational linguistics, natural language processing and any other context that supports multilingual knowledge representation methods.

TOPICS OF INTEREST

We invite presentations of methodologies, experiments, use cases, applications and position papers regarding the creation, publication or application of semantic-based language data collections and their interoperability with other resources, including their description by means of metadata. This includes, but is not limited to, the following:

&#183;         multilingual knowledge engineering methods, approaches, and applications
&#183;         modeling linguistic, lexical, and terminological data and metadata with semantic technologies
&#183;         multilingual language resources and Linked Data
&#183;         localization methodologies for knowledge representation systems
&#183;         semantically interoperable language resources
&#183;         crosslingual and multilingual information access
&#183;         translation management and knowledge engineering
&#183;         language technology for semantic-based information access
&#183;         evaluation of multilingual knowledge representation systems
&#183;         theoretical approaches to multilingual knowledge representation
&#183;         assistive technologies and intelligent user interfaces for disabled people
&#183;         standards in all realted fields (language resources, web tools, software components, etc.)

PAPER SUBMISSIONS

Papers of 8 to 10 pages, short papers of 4 to 6 pages (oral/poster presentation at workshop)  or 1-2 pages long position papers for a panel  discussion, may be submitted using
