Technically and Financially co-sponsored by TEMS, IEEE

ICDIM 2017 hosts the following co-located workshops during the 
conference.
Third Workshop on Internet of Everything (IoE)
Third International Workshop on 'Future Big Data' (FBD 2017)
Third Workshop on Intelligent Information Systems (IIS 2017)
Sixth Workshop on &quot;Advanced Techniques on Data Analytics and Data 
Visualization&quot;


Following the successful earlier conferences at Bangalore (2006), Lyon 
(2007), London (2008), Michigan (2009) , Thunder Bay (2010), Melbourne 
(2011), Macau (2012), Islamabad (2013), Thailand (2014) Republic of 
Korea (South Korea)(2015) and Porto (2016), the Twelfth event is being 
organized at Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan in 2017. The 
International Conference on Digital Information Management is a 
multidisciplinary conference on digital information management, science 
and technology. The principal aim of this conference is to bring people 
in academia, research laboratories and industry together, and offer a 
collaborative platform to address the emerging issues and solutions in 
digital information science and technology.

Digital Information technologies are gaining maturity and rapid momentum 
in adoption across disciplines. The digital community is producing new 
ways of using digital information technologies for integrating and 
making sense out of various data ranging from real/live streams and 
simulations to analytics data analysis, in support of mining of 
knowledge. The conference will feature original research and industrial 
papers on the theory, design and implementation of digital information 
systems, as well as demonstrations, tutorials, workshops and industrial 
presentations.
