<PRE>(Please excuse cross-postings.)TIAD 2017 Shared Task: Translation Inference
Across Dictionaries2nd Call for participation &#8211; Review Committee announced
<A HREF="https://tiad2017.wordpress.comOverview">https://tiad2017.wordpress.comOverview</A>

Various methods and techniques have been explored in the past in the aim of
automatically generating new bilingual (and multilingual) dictionaries from
existing ones, for instance using one (or more) language(s) as a pivot
between two other source and target languages. However, such efforts were
usually conducted on different types of datasets and evaluated in different
ways, making it difficult to compare due to the different experimental
setups and evaluation metrics.

TIAD-2017 is launched with the intention of offering quality lexical
resources for a coherent experiment that enables reliable validation of
results and solid comparison of methods and techniques used for the
automatic generation of translations across languages. This initiative aims
also to stimulate and enhance further research on the topic. It will make
use of cross-lingual lexicographic data of K Dictionaries (KD), which will
serve also to validate the results along with human assessment. The systems
developed by participants and their results will be presented at a workshop
that will be held as part of the first Language, Data and Knowledge
conference in Galway, Ireland, on 18 June 2017 (<A HREF="http://ldk2017.org">http://ldk2017.org</A>). The
papers describing the participant systems will be published on CEUR-WS (
<A HREF="http://ceur-ws.org">http://ceur-ws.org</A>).
Task definition

The objective of the task is to indirectly generate translations for three
language pairs, based on already known translations among eight languages
in 14 bilingual dictionaries, involving four possible paths &#8211; all from
German to Brazilian Portuguese &#8211; that feature between 1 to 4 pivot
languages.

The test dataset consists of 100 randomly-selected German dictionary
entries with their translations into a second language, and recursively
exploring further translations in chained-up dictionaries &#8211; including up to
817 entries with 1,532 translation equivalents in the largest language pair
that is provided. Besides the headwords and translations, the data includes
information about the parts of speech, subject domains and synonyms, as
well as examples of usage and their translations.

The following language pairs are provided for the four paths:

(a)    German &gt; English &gt; Portuguese

(b)   German &gt; Japanese &gt; Spanish &gt; Portuguese

(c)    German &gt; Danish &gt; French &gt; Spanish &gt; Portuguese

(d)   German &gt; Dutch &gt; Spanish &gt; Danish &gt; French &gt; Portuguese

Also included are four Portuguese &gt; German datasets, for *closing the loop* in
each path, to help with the validation of the results.

The three new language pairs that should be generated are:

(1)    German &gt; Portuguese

(2)    Danish &gt; Spanish

(3)    Dutch &gt; French

Evaluation of the results of each system will be carried out against KD&#8217;s
manually compiled dictionaries for these pairs from the Global Series and
other resources, as well as by human translators.

Participants can contribute on either or both of the following tracks:

(1)    Systems that use only the KD data released for the task

(2)    Systems that exploit, in addition to the KD data, other freely
available sources of background knowledge (e.g., lexical linked open data
and parallel corpora) to improve performance

Beyond performance, participants are encouraged to consider the following
issues in particular:

&#183;         The role of the language family with respect to the newly
generated pairs

&#183;         The asymmetry of pairs, and how translation direction affects the
results

&#183;         The behavior of different parts-of-speech among different
languages

&#183;         The role the number of pivots plays in the process
