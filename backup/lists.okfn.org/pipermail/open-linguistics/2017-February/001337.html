FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS

The European Language Resource Association (ELRA) is glad to announce the
11th edition of LREC, organised with the support of international
organisations &#8211; many from Asia: the Asian Federation of Natural Language
Processing (AFNLP), Oriental COCOSDA, the Association of Natural Language
Processing - Japan, the Chinese Information Processing Society of China, the
Linguistic Data Consortium, ...

CONFERENCE AIMS
LREC is the major event on Language Resources (LRs) and Evaluation for Human
Language Technologies (HLT). LREC aims to provide an overview of the
state-of-the-art, explore new R&amp;D directions and emerging trends, exchange
information regarding LRs and their applications, evaluation methodologies
and tools, communicate on-going and planned activities, identify industrial
uses and needs, and address requirements from e-science and e-society, with
respect to scientific, technology, policy and organisational issues.

For this edition, LREC goes East in order to support a stronger interaction
and synergy with the Asian NLP community and to help promoting Asian Language
Resources and Language Technologies.

LREC provides a unique forum for researchers, industrials and funding
agencies from a wide spectrum of related disciplines to discuss issues and
opportunities, find new synergies and promote initiatives for international
cooperation, in support of investigations in language sciences, progress in
language technologies (LTs) and development of corresponding products,
services and applications, and standards.

CONFERENCE TOPICS
Issues in the design, construction and use of LRs: text, speech, sign,
gesture, image, in single or multimodal/multimedia data
* Guidelines, standards, best practices and models for LRs interoperability
* Methodologies and tools for LRs construction and annotation
* Methodologies and tools for extraction and acquisition of knowledge
* Ontologies, terminology and knowledge representation
* LRs and Semantic Web
* LRs and Crowdsourcing
* Metadata for LRs and semantic/content mark-up

Exploitation of LRs in systems and applications
* Sign language, multimedia information and multimodal communication
* LRs in systems and applications such as: information extraction,
information retrieval, audio-visual and multimedia search, speech dictation,
meeting transcription, Computer Aided Language Learning, training and
education, mobile communication, machine translation, speech translation,
summarisation, web services, semantic search, text mining, inferencing,
reasoning, sentiment analysis/opinion mining, etc.
* Interfaces: (speech-based) dialogue systems, natural language and
multimodal/multisensory interactions, voice-activated services, etc.
* Use of (multilingual) LRs in various fields of application like
e-government, e-participation, e-culture, e-health, mobile applications,
digital humanities, social sciences, etc.
* Industrial LRs requirements
* User needs, LT for accessibility

Issues in LT evaluation
* LT evaluation methodologies, protocols and measures
* Validation and quality assurance of LRs
* Benchmarking of systems and products
* Usability evaluation of HLT-based user interfaces and dialogue systems
* User satisfaction evaluation

General issues regarding LRs &amp; Evaluation
* International and national activities, projects and initiatives
* Priorities, perspectives, strategies in national and international policies
for LRs
* Multilingual issues, language coverage and diversity, less-resourced
languages
* Open, linked and shared data and tools, open and collaborative
architectures
* Replicability and reproducibility issues
* Organisational, economical, ethical and legal issues

LREC 2018 HOT TOPICS

Asian Language Resources
Special attention will be devoted to highlight the wide variety of
initiatives for the creation, use and evaluation of Asian Language Resources
and Technologies. Special attention will be paid to Less-Resourced Languages
in the Asian area, including (local) Sign Languages.

International Contribution to Olympics 2020
LREC 2018 would like to promote all LTs that would support better
interactions and communications between the Olympics 2020 visitors and the
local hosts. This involves all speech- and text-based computer interactions,
speech/sign to speech/sign translations, human-human communications mediated
by computers, etc. Assessment of the above mentioned technologies is also an
important area within LREC 2018.

Language Resources in the Online World
In a time in which more and more (language) data are generated, either by
human beings or by machines, and directly streamed, the question arises how
LRs and LTs can cope with this development. A first challenge is to address
and to provide for correctives to hate speeches, cyberbullying, fake news,
etc. Can LT provide means to process and respond in a timely manner to such
language data streamed in a huge amount at high speed? In this context,
language technologists have to intensify cooperation with humanities,
especially social and political sciences, psychology but also economics, and
more.

DESCRIBE AND SHARE YOUR LRs!
In addition to describing your LRs in the LRE Map &#8211; now a normal step in
the submission procedure of many conferences &#8211; LREC recognises the
importance of sharing resources and making them available to the community.
When submitting a paper, you will be offered the possibility to share your
LRs (data, tools, web-services, etc.), uploading them in a special LREC
repository set up by ELRA. Your LRs will be made available to all LREC
participants before the conference, to be re-used, compared, analysed. This
effort of sharing LRs, linked to the LRE Map for their description,
contributes to creating a common repository where everyone can deposit and
share data.

PROGRAMME
The Scientific Programme will include invited talks, oral presentations,
poster and demo presentations, and panels, in addition to a keynote address
by the winner of the Antonio Zampolli Prize.
We will also organise an Industrial Track.

SUBMISSIONS AND DATES
Submission of proposals for oral and poster (or poster+demo) papers:
September 25, 2017
* LREC2018 asks for extended abstracts of no less than 3000 words (references
excluded), which must strictly follow the LREC stylesheet which will be
available on the conference website. Extended abstracts should be submitted
through START and will be peer-reviewed.
Submission of proposals for panels, workshops and tutorials: September 25,
2017
* Proposals should be submitted via an online form on the LREC website and
will be reviewed by the Programme Committee.

PROCEEDINGS
The Proceedings will include both oral and poster papers, in the same format.
Final papers will range from 4 to 8 pages, with no difference in quality
between shorter and longer submissions.
There is also no difference in quality between oral and poster presentations.
Only the appropriateness of the type of communication (more or less
interactive) to the content of the paper will be considered.
The importance of LREC in Natural Language Processing is reflected by the
H5-Index citation ranking in Google Scholar: LREC is ranked 3rd among
Computational Linguistics conferences. In addition, since 2010, LREC
Proceedings are included in the Thomson Reuters Conference Proceedings
Citation Index.
