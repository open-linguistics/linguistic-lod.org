***************************************************************

&#160;
--- Early registration deadline: February 14, 2018 ---

&#160;

***************************************************************

&#160;
SCOPE:

&#160;

DeepLearn 2018 will be a research training event with a global scope aiming at updating participants about the most recent advances in the critical and fast developing area of deep learning. This is a branch of artificial intelligence covering a spectrum of current exciting machine learning research and industrial innovation that provides more efficient algorithms to deal with large-scale data in neurosciences, computer vision, speech recognition, language processing, human-computer interaction, drug discovery, biomedical informatics, healthcare, recommender systems, learning theory, robotics, games, etc. Renowned academics and industry pioneers will lecture and share their views with the audience.

&#160;

Most deep learning subareas will be displayed, and main challenges identified through 2 keynote lectures, 24 six-hour courses, and 1 round table, which will tackle the most active and promising topics. The organizers are convinced that outstanding speakers will attract the brightest and most motivated students. Interaction will be a main component of the event.

&#160;

An open session will give participants the opportunity to present their own work in progress in 5 minutes. Moreover, there will be two special sessions with industrial and recruitment profiles.

&#160;
ADDRESSED TO:

&#160;

Master's students, PhD students, postdocs, and industry practitioners will be typical profiles of participants. However, there are no formal pre-requisites for attendance in terms of academic degrees. Since there will be a variety of levels, specific knowledge background may be assumed for some of the courses. Overall, DeepLearn 2018 is addressed to students, researchers and practitioners who want to keep themselves updated about recent developments and future trends. All will surely find it fruitful to listen and discuss with major researchers, industry leaders and innovators.

&#160;
STRUCTURE:

&#160;

3 courses will run in parallel during the whole event. Participants will be able to freely choose the courses they wish to attend as well as to move from one to another.

&#160;
VENUE:

&#160;

DeepLearn 2018 will take place in Genova, the capital city of Liguria, inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List and with one of the most important ports of the Mediterranean. The venue will be:
