&#8203;

WILDRE &#8211; the 4th workshop on Indian Language Data: Resources and Evaluation
is being organized in Miyazaki, Japan on 12h May, 2018 under the LREC
platform. India has a huge linguistic diversity and has seen concerted
efforts from the Indian government and industry towards developing language
resources. European Language Resource Association (ELRA) and its associate
organizations have been very active and successful in addressing the
challenges and opportunities related to language resource creation and
evaluation. It is therefore a great opportunity for resource creators of
Indian languages to showcase their work on this platform and also to
interact and learn from those involved in similar initiatives all over the
world. The broader objectives of the WILDRE will be

   -

   To map the status of Indian Language Resources
   -

   To investigate challenges related to creating and sharing various levels
   of language resources
   -

   To promote a dialogue between language resource developers and users
   -

   To provide opportunity for researchers from India to collaborate with
   researchers from other parts of the world

*DATES *

January 09, 2018 Paper submissions due *(**Extended Deadline**)*

February 15, 2018 Paper notification of acceptance

March 01, 2018 Camera-ready papers due

May 12, 2018 Workshop


*SUBMISSIONS *

Papers must describe original, completed or in progress, and unpublished
work. Each submission will be reviewed by three program committee members.

Accepted papers will be given up to 10 pages (for full papers) 5 pages (for
short papers and posters) in the workshop proceedings, and will be
presented oral presentation or poster.

Papers should be formatted according to the LREC style-sheet, which is
provided on the LREC 2018 website (
<A HREF="http://lrec2018.lrec-conf.org/en/submission/authors-kit/">http://lrec2018.lrec-conf.org/en/submission/authors-kit/</A>). Please submit
papers in PDF format to the LREC website.

We are seeking submissions under the following category

   -

   Full papers (10 pages)
   -

   Short papers (work in progress &#8211; 5 pages)
   -

   Posters (innovative ideas/proposals, research proposal of students)
   -

   Demo (of working online/standalone systems)

WILDRE-4 will have a special focus on Demos of Indian Language Technology.
In the past few years, as more resources have been developed and made
available, there has been an increased activity in developing usable
technology using these. WILDRE-4 would like to encourage and widen the Demo
track to allow the community to showcase their demos and have mutually
beneficial interactions with each other as well as resource developers.

WILRE-4 will invite technical, policy and position paper submissions on the
following topics related to Indian Language Resources:

   -

   Digital Humanities, heritage computing
   -

   Corpora - text, speech, multimodal, methodologies, annotation and tools
   -

   Lexicons and Machine-readable dictionaries
   -

   Ontologies, Grammars
   -

   Language resources for basic NLP, IR, Machine Translation and Speech
   Technology tasks, tools and Infrastructure for constructing and sharing
   language resources
   -

   Standards or specifications for language resources applications
   -

   Licensing and copyright issues

Both submission and review processes handled electronically. The review
process will be *double blind*. The workshop website will provide the
submission guidelines and the link for the electronic submission.

When submitting a paper from the START page, authors will be asked to
provide essential information about resources (in a broad sense, i.e. also
technologies, standards, evaluation kits, etc.) that have been used for the
work described in the paper or are a new result of your research. Moreover,
ELRA encourages all LREC authors to share the described LRs (data, tools,
services, etc.), to enable their reuse, replicability of experiments,
including evaluation ones, etc.
