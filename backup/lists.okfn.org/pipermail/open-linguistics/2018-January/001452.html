THEME OF THE CONFERENCE

======================================================================

Digital Transformation - an imperative for today's business markets

Nowadays,  digital technologies transform the way the business is made, 
the companies grow,  the links  between people  are created and evolve, 
as well  as many other domains.  The digital  transformation means that 
digital usages inherently enable new types of innovation and creativity
in various domains.  In general,  Digital Transformation can be defined 
as  an integration  of digital technology  into all  areas of business, 
resulting in fundamental changes to how businesses operate and how they 
deliver value to their customers.  The BIS Conference traditionally has 
focused on actual trends of development, implementation and application 
of business information systems in different domains. Thus, to continue 
this tradition,  the upcoming edition  of BIS will focus on the Digital 
Transformation  that  affects  both  individual  businesses  and  whole 
domains,  such as e.g.  administration,  communication,  art, medicine, 
healthcare, finance and science.

The  Digital  Transformation  is described  as  'the total  and overall 
societal  effect  of  digitalization'.  Digitization  has  enabled  the 
process of digitalization, which resulted in transformation of existing 
business models,  socio-economic structures, legal and policy measures, 
organizational patterns, cultural barriers, etc.  There are a number of 
reasons  why  businesses  undergo  Digital  Transformation.   The  main 
argument  is that  they  simply have  to.  With  the evolving  business 
markets,  companies that want to  succeed must  understand how to apply 
technology  to support strategical  decisions and  realise the visions. 
However, there are many ways how it may be achieved. Thus, the BIS 2018 
Conference  wants to  drive the  discussion of  Digital  Transformation 
related to problems,  challenges and opportunities for today&#226;&#128;&#153;s business 
markets. We invite  researchers  and business  practitioners to present 
and publish  their  latest research  results.  Our  goal is  to  enable 
sharing  theoretical  and   practical  knowledge  of  ongoing   Digital 
Transformation  activities  and  thus to inspire  researchers  to think 
outside the box. We hope that the inspirations from the Conference will 
lead  to   further  innovations   being  the  next  stage  of   Digital 
Transformation.
