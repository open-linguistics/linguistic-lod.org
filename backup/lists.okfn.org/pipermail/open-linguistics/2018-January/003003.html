<PRE>Dear Christian,

Even if the very first star of the high-quality &quot;5 star linked data&quot; [1] 
imposes that license must be open, there are some people who would like 
to soften this requirement, making the O in LOD to simply mean &quot;open 
format&quot;. Furthermore, the European Union is striving towards 
establishing data markets, where obviously licenses cannot be open and 
where linked data may play a role (see how they are actively funding, 
right now, such research projects).

In my opinion, limiting the LLOD to strictly open datasets is a mistake, 
as it would depict a reality only partially. The webpage at 
<A HREF="http://linguistic-lod.org/llod-cloud">http://linguistic-lod.org/llod-cloud</A> already displays the cloud by 
license; I cannot possibly imagine how to improve that...

Regards,
V&#237;ctor

&gt;<i> Dear all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> when we first began developing the Linguistic Linked Open Data cloud 
</I>&gt;<i> diagram, we followed a highly permissive approach on criteria for 
</I>&gt;<i> inclusion, with the idea to move if from an abstract vision to a set 
</I>&gt;<i> of actually usable resources -- in fact the first versions of the 
</I>&gt;<i> diagram (before the MLODE workshop in September 2012) are explicitly 
</I>&gt;<i> referred to as &quot;drafts&quot; because we included resources whose conversion 
</I>&gt;<i> to LOD had only been *promised* the time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, the quality criteria have been continuously enforced since 
</I>&gt;<i> then. This includes availability, size, number of links, and an 
</I>&gt;<i> explicit definition of linguistic relevance as an entry criterion, so 
</I>&gt;<i> that these are now roughly equivalent with the LOD criteria.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Along with that, we did *not* enforce an Open Definition-conformant 
</I>&gt;<i> license (<A HREF="http://opendefinition.org/licenses/">http://opendefinition.org/licenses/</A>). In particular, 
</I>&gt;<i> arguments have been brought forward to include non-commercial 
</I>&gt;<i> resources. One of the reasons is that many classical resources 
</I>&gt;<i> developed during the 1990s and early 2000s are released under 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;academic&quot; licenses and that even today, entire sub-communities in 
</I>&gt;<i> linguistics tend to be very protective about their data. Encouraging 
</I>&gt;<i> noncommercial licenses is a viable compromise to reach out to these 
</I>&gt;<i> communities without compromising the idea of embracing openness 
</I>&gt;<i> altogether. We did have discussions about this from the very 
</I>&gt;<i> beginning, and there are good arguments for either view, but we did 
</I>&gt;<i> *not* manage to establish a consensus to exclude, in particular, 
</I>&gt;<i> NC-licensed data.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For the moment, openness is (implicitly) defined as being in line with 
</I>&gt;<i> the LOD diagram, i.e., we inherit its view that &quot;we take a liberal 
</I>&gt;<i> view of what we consider &#8220;open&#8221;. If the data is openly accessible from 
</I>&gt;<i> a network point of view &#8211; that is, it's not behind an authorization 
</I>&gt;<i> check or paywall&quot; (<A HREF="http://lod-cloud.net/">http://lod-cloud.net/</A>). This approach can be 
</I>&gt;<i> criticized for good reasons, but it is an established and transparent 
</I>&gt;<i> practice that goes back to the original LOD diagram by Cyganiak and 
</I>&gt;<i> Jentzsch, and that has also been documented since then.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Part of this documentation is that under 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://linguistic-lod.org/llod-cloud,">http://linguistic-lod.org/llod-cloud,</A> users can get an alternative 
</I>&gt;<i> visualization of the diagram with respect to licenses, and as can be 
</I>&gt;<i> easily seen, about half of the LLOD bubbles are non-commercial, three 
</I>&gt;<i> have no explicit license (which means a restrictive license, in 
</I>&gt;<i> Germany, at least), and three more are labeled as &quot;closed&quot; (which may 
</I>&gt;<i> in fact mean that different sub-resources have different licenses, 
</I>&gt;<i> e.g., Multext-East[<A HREF="http://nl.ijs.si/ME/V4/">http://nl.ijs.si/ME/V4/</A>], which includes CC-BY-SA 
</I>&gt;<i> and CC-BY-NC lexica as well as corpus data under a 
</I>&gt;<i> restricted/non-commercial license).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, this can be a problem for data providers who find their NC 
</I>&gt;<i> data in the (L)LOD diagram without being &quot;Open&quot; according to the Open 
</I>&gt;<i> Definition, as users of this data may get a wrong impression about 
</I>&gt;<i> their usage rights -- despite warnings such as &quot;Before using any data, 
</I>&gt;<i> you should always check the publisher's website for the terms and 
</I>&gt;<i> conditions&quot; (<A HREF="http://lod-cloud.net/">http://lod-cloud.net/</A>).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The question now is what to do about this situation. Personally, I 
</I>&gt;<i> would prefer to roughly stay with the current practice for the LOD and 
</I>&gt;<i> LLOD diagrams for the moment, but to provide an explicit statement 
</I>&gt;<i> that *our* definition of openness exceeds beyond the Open Definition 
</I>&gt;<i> by including non-commercial/&quot;academic&quot; resources, because this is an 
</I>&gt;<i> explicit need in (parts of) our community. At the same time, given 
</I>&gt;<i> such a statement, resources with unclear (= restrictive) licenses 
</I>&gt;<i> should be removed from the diagram. As these are quantitatively 
</I>&gt;<i> marginal anyway, this should not affect the usability of LLOD 
</I>&gt;<i> resources and the diagram in comparison to its current state.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In any case, this is for the immediate future only. At some point in 
</I>&gt;<i> the future, after intense lobbying among our peers and (hopefully) 
</I>&gt;<i> growing imporance of OpenDefinition-compliant licenses, we should 
</I>&gt;<i> certainly adopt a stricter definition, but for the moment, the growth 
</I>&gt;<i> in resources, demonstrating their use and developing applications of 
</I>&gt;<i> (L)LOD should -- IMHO -- take priority over ideological purity until 
</I>&gt;<i> it is established as a conventional approach for (certain kinds of) 
</I>&gt;<i> linguistic data.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This may be controversial, though, so, what do others think?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best,
</I>&gt;<i> Christian
