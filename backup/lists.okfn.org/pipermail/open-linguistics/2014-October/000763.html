Dear Colleagues,

I am glad to share with you the following call. Please distribute widely!

*************************

LRE Journal Special Issue: &#8220;Under-resourced Languages, Collaborative
Approaches and Linked Open Data: Resources, Methods and Applications&#8221;

Second Call for Papers

(apologies for multiple postings)

SUBMISSION DATE: November 30, 2014

CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS
Under-resourced languages are generally described as languages that suffer
from a chronic lack of available resources, from human, financial, and time
resources to linguistic ones (language data and language technology), and
often also experience the fragmentation of efforts in resource development.
This situation is exacerbated by the realization that as technology
progresses and the demand for localised languages services over digital
devices increases, the divide between adequately- and under-resourced
languages keeps widening. Given that most of the world&#8217;s almost 7000
languages are not adequately resourced, much work needs to be done in order
to support their existence in the digital age.

Although the destiny of a language is primarily determined by its native
speakers and broader cultural context, the technological development of an
under-resourced language offers such a language a strategic opportunity to
have the same &#8220;digital dignity&#8221;, &#8220;digital identity&#8221; and &#8220;digital longevity&#8221;
as large, well-developed languages on the Web.

The Linked (Open) Data framework and the emerging Linguistic Linked (Open)
Data infrastructure offer novel opportunities for under-resourced
languages. On the one hand, Linked Data offers ways of exposing existing
high quality, albeit small, language resources in the Semantic Web and, on
the other hand, allows for the development of new state-of-the-art
resources without necessarily having to rely on the availability of
sophisticated language processing support.

This special issue arises from the imperative to maintain cultural and
language diversity and from the basic right of all communities, languages,
and cultures to be &#8220;first class citizens&#8221; in an age driven by information,
knowledge and understanding. In this spirit, this special issue focuses on
three strategic approaches to augment the development of resources for
under-resourced languages to achieve a level potentially comparable to
well-resourced, technologically advanced languages, viz. a) using the crowd
and collaborative platforms; b) using technologies of interoperability with
well-developed languages; and c) using Semantic Web technologies and, more
specifically, Linked Data.

We invite original contributions, not published before and not under
consideration for publication elsewhere, that address one or more of the
following questions by means of one or more of the three approaches
mentioned above:

&#8226; How can collaborative approaches and technologies be fruitfully applied
to the accelerated development and sharing of high quality resources for
under-resourced languages?

&#8226; How can such resources be best stored, exposed and accessed by end users
and applications?

&#8226; How can small language resources be re-used efficiently and effectively,
reach larger audiences and be integrated into applications?

&#8226; How can multilingual and cross-lingual interoperability of language
resources, methods and applications be supported, also between languages
that belong to different language families?

&#8226; How can existing language resource infrastructures be scaled to thousands
of languages?

&#8226; How can research on and resource development for under-resourced
languages benefit from current advances in semantic and semantic web
technologies, and specifically the Linked Data framework?
