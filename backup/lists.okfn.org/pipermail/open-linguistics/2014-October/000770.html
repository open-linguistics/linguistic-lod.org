<PRE>Call for Workshops: ESWC 2015


The organisers of the 12th Extended Semantic Web Conference (ESWC
2015) cordially invite you to submit a workshop proposal. ESWC is a
major venue for discussing the latest scientific results and
innovations in the field of semantic technologies on the Web and
Linked Data, attracting a high number of high-quality submissions and
participants from academia and industry alike.


Co-located workshops at ESWC conferences are distinguished meeting
points for discussing ongoing work and the latest ideas related to
semantic technologies and the Semantic Web. Of particular interest are
workshop proposals from an interdisciplinary standpoint, proposals
focusing on a specific technology of general interest, or those
gathering a sub-community. We encourage the submission of workshop
proposals on:

* Fundamental problems of the Semantic Web / Linked Data such as
ontology mining, ontology alignment, heterogeneity, scalability and
distribution, etc.,
* Applications of Semantic Web technologies in specific domains,
* Important enabling technologies and their adaptation to the needs of
the Semantic Web,
* Aspects of Semantic Web research that have been neglected so far
(e.g., uncertainty reasoning), and
* Techniques and methods from other research fields that are of
relevance for Semantic Web research (e.g., machine learning, NLP, data
mining).


General Information and Criteria


Each proposal will be reviewed by the members of the workshop
programme committee, and ranked based on the overall quality of the
proposal and the workshop's fit to the conference as detailed below.
Their recommendations will determine the final decision on the
acceptance / rejection of each proposal, which is to be taken by the
Workshop Chairs as well as by the Local and General Chairs of ESWC
2015.

The criteria for judging the quality of workshop proposals are as follows:

* Co-located workshops cover topics falling in the general scope of
the ESWC conference.
* Workshops are intended to be genuine interactive events and not
mini-conferences.
* We welcome workshops with creative structures and organisations that
attract various types of contributions and ensure rich interactions.
* Workshops should have a clear focus on a specific technology,
problem or application.
* There is potentially a significant community interested in the
workshop's topic.
* Workshop duration can be half a day or a full day.
* We strongly advise having more than one organiser and no more than
four, preferably from different institutions, bringing different
perspectives to the workshop topic.


In case overlapping workshops are proposed, the Workshop Chairs may
contact the organisers to discuss the possibility of merging
workshops. Please note that the duration of a workshop might need to
be adjusted based on the overall number of submissions received.
Furthermore, workshops that receive less than 5 submissions or have
less than 10 people registered at the early registration deadline
might be canceled.

The organisers of accepted workshops will be responsible for their own
reviewing process, best paper award, publicity (e.g., website,
timelines and call for papers), and proceedings production. They will
be required to closely cooperate with the Workshop Chairs and the ESWC
2015 Local Chairs to finalise all organisational details. Workshop
attendees must pay the ESWC 2015 workshop registration fee, as well as
the conference registration fee.


Each accepted workshop will get one free registration for one of its
organisers for workshops and tutorials at the pre-conference days,
i.e. he/she will only pay the main conference fee.

Submission Guidelines


Workshop proposals have to be submitted via EasyChair at
<A HREF="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eswc2015workshops.">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eswc2015workshops.</A> Each
proposal must consist of a single PDF document written in English, not
longer than four pages, which contains the following information:

1. The title and brief technical description of the workshop,
specifying its goals and motivation.
2. A brief discussion of why the topic is of particular interest at this time.
3. A brief description of why and to whom the workshop is of interest,
the workshop audience, as well as the expected number of participants.
4. A brief description (draft outline) of the proposed workshop
format, discussing the mix of events and activities such as paper
presentations, invited talks, panels, hacking sessions, or general
discussion slots, and an approximate timeline.
5. A list of (potential) members of the program committee (at least
50% have to be known and confirmed at the time of the proposal).
6. An indication of whether the workshop should be considered for a
half-day or full-day event.
7. Related workshops and conferences, i.e. specify if this is the
continuation of a workshop series or is a new workshop to address an
emerging issue. Please provide information about past versions of this
workshop and other related workshops (including URLs and submission /
acceptance counts, if available).
8. Names and contact information of the workshop organisers/chair(s)
(name, affiliation, email address, homepage and short (one paragraph)
biography of each chair, explaining the chair's expertise for the
workshop including past experience in organising / facilitating
workshops). Preferably provide a single contact person per submission.
9. A one-page draft of the call for papers (CFP).


The best papers from each workshop will be included in the
supplementary proceedings of ESWC 2015, which will appear in the
Springer LNCS series.
