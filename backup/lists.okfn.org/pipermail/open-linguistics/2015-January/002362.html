After the big success of the first two DBpedia Community Meeting in 
Amsterdam and Leipzig with more than 70 international participants, the 
third edition of the event will take place in Dublin, Ireland, on 
February 9, 2015.

The meeting will have a special focus on DBpedia in Digital Humanities, 
the bootstrapping of an Irish DBpedia Community, discussion for the 
directions of the DBpedia ontology and the new structure of the DBpedia 
Association.

The DBpedia Project has developed from a hosted data set to the public 
data infrastructure for the Web of Data. The DBpedia Community Meeting 
aims to get together three major groups being involved in DBpedia: the 
DBpedia developers and maintainers, the communities of the individual 
DBpedia language chapters and, of course, the DBpedia users.

Acknowledgements
============
  * The ALIGNED and CENDARI projects for hosting and organisational support.
  * Trinity Long Room Hub
  * ADAPT Centre
  * Digital Repository of Ireland
  * OpenLink Software (<A HREF="http://www.openlinksw.com/">http://www.openlinksw.com/</A>) for continuous 
hosting of the main DBpedia Endpoint

Preliminary Agenda
============
The meeting will be held at Trinity Long Room Hub (2nd floor), break-out 
sessions will also be in the School of Computer Science and Statistics, 
Trinity College Dublin, Ireland on Feb. 9, 2015. The first session will 
contain talks and discussions about the DBpedia State-of-Play, where 
core members of the DBpedia community present certain aspects of DBpedia 
and the audience is invited to give feedback and ask questions. The 
second session will be dedicated to users of DBpedia. A detailed program 
will be continuously updated on the DBpedia Website. There will be a 
dedicated break-out session on DBpedia and Digital Humanities as well as 
the future directions of the DBpedia Ontology. Again, we also plan to 
have several break-out sessions for trending DBpedia topics to enable 
further discussion on how to improve DBpedia.


Call for Contributions
=============
We would like to invite companies, organisations, research groups and 
other projects to shortly present their use cases for DBpedia and give 
input on how we can improve DBpedia for users. Free slots still 
available and will be handled on a first come first serve basis. 
Contribution proposals include (but are not limited to) presentations, 
posters, demos, lightning talks and session suggestions. For Dublin we 
are especially interested to hear from DBpedia users, developers 
involved in the Digital Humanities area.

About DBpedia
=========
Source: <A HREF="http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/system/files/swj499.pdf">http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/system/files/swj499.pdf</A>

The DBpedia community project extracts structured, multilingual 
knowledge from Wikipedia and makes it freely available using Semantic 
Web and Linked Data standards. The extracted knowledge, comprising more 
than 1.8 billion facts, is structured according to an ontology 
maintained by the community. The knowledge is obtained from different 
Wikipedia language editions, thus covering more than 100 languages, and 
mapped to the community ontology. The resulting data sets are linked to 
more than 30 other data sets in the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud. The 
DBpedia project was started in 2006 and has meanwhile attracted large 
interest in research and practice. Being a central part of the LOD 
cloud, it serves as a connection hub for other data sets. For the 
research community, DBpedia provides a testbed serving real world data 
spanning many domains and languages. Due to the continuous growth of 
Wikipedia, DBpedia also provides an increasing added value for data 
acquisition, re-use and integration tasks within organisations. In this 
system report, we give an overview over the DBpedia community project, 
including its architecture, technical implementation, maintenance, 
internationalisation, usage statistics and showcase some popular DBpedia 
applications.

Travel Grants / Sponsorship
=================
Some of the DBpedia developers work on DBpedia in their free-time and 
will not have institutional funding to come to the meeting. Therefore, 
we are still looking for sponsors for travel grants (as well as coffee 
and food for the sessions). If you are interested to sponsor this 
meeting, please fill out this form to request more information: 
<A HREF="http://goo.gl/forms/a2K1WDg5HW">http://goo.gl/forms/a2K1WDg5HW</A>

Given we can acquire a sponsor, participants can apply for a travel 
grant here: <A HREF="http://goo.gl/forms/a2K1WDg5HW.">http://goo.gl/forms/a2K1WDg5HW.</A>

These grants will be awarded depending on the standing in the community 
and community activity, e.g. Google Summer of Code participation or Git 
Commits to DBpedia framework, activity on the mailing lists, etc.

We hope to see you all in Dublin:
