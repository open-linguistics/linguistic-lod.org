<PRE>Hello!

Excuse my intrusion into the debate without introducing myself. As I 
work at the Institute of Estonian Language, I feel included in 
Christian's second point. But I want to argue against the importance of 
having an associated publication.

I think there exists many datasets without a publication that can be 
even more linguistically motivated than those having a publication in 
accord. They often convey more pragmatic semantics in a dictionary-like 
sense (thus exposing mainly &quot;is_a&quot; kind of relations. This kind of 
datasets are often developed inside a working group or individual person 
that might not match the criteria of specialization in linguistics etc, 
but they are done for solving the need of a &quot;look-up function&quot;. This 
functionality might very well be general enough to be used by others. I 
think this &quot;usability by others&quot; factor could be said to convey a 
linguistic relevance, if we look at them as linguistic signs as 
agreed-upon but arbitrary :-).

Maybe I just got the logic wrong behind Christian's list: a logical AND 
for the two points feels for me too strict. But also, a logical OR feels 
too lax (for a country with 1.5 million people, specialization is 
necessarily a shallower concept than in a big country).

Best wishes
