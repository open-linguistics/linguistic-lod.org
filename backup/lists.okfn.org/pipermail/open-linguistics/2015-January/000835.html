INTERNATIONAL SUMMER SCHOOL ON INFORMATION SECURITY

InfoSec 2015

Tarragona, Spain

July 6-10, 2015

Organized by
Rovira i Virgili University

<A HREF="http://grammars.grlmc.com/InfoSec2015/">http://grammars.grlmc.com/InfoSec2015/</A>

**********************************************************************

--- 2nd registration deadline: February 3, 2015 ---

**********************************************************************

AIM:

InfoSec 2015 will be a major research training event addressed to graduates
and postgraduates in the first steps of their academic career. With a global
scope, it aims at updating them about the most recent advances in the
critical and fast developing area of information security, which covers a
large spectrum of current exciting academic research and industrial
innovation. It refers to procedures to defend information from unauthorized
access, use, modification, recording or destruction, with a critical role to
play in order to avoid or minimize risks in the digital world. Renowned
academics and industry pioneers will lecture and share their views with the
audience.

Most information security subareas will be displayed, namely: computer
security, cryptography, privacy, cyber security, mobile security, network
security, world wide web security, fraud prevention, data protection, etc.
Main challenges of information security will be identified through 4 keynote
lectures, 33 six-hour courses, and 1 round table, which will tackle the most
active and promising topics. The organizers believe outstanding speakers
will attract the brightest and most motivated students. Interaction will be
a main component of the event.

ADDRESSED TO:

Graduates and postgraduates from around the world. There are no formal
pre-requisites in terms of academic degrees. However, since there will be
differences in the course levels, specific background knowledge may be
required for some of them.

InfoSec 2015 is also appropriate for more senior people who want to keep
themselves updated on recent developments and future trends. They will
surely find it fruitful to listen and discuss with major researchers,
industry leaders and innovators.

REGIME:

In addition to keynotes, 4 courses will run in parallel during the whole
event. Participants will be able to freely choose the courses they will be
willing to attend as well as to move from one to another.
