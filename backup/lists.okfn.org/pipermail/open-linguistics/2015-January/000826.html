1st Summer Datathon on Linguistic Linked Open Data (SD-LLOD&#8217;15)

===============================================================

The 1st Summer Datathon on Linguistic Linked Open Data (SD-LLOD-15) will be
held from June 15th to 19th 2015 at Residencia Lucas Olaz&#225;bal of
Universidad Polit&#233;cnica de Madrid, Cercedilla, Madrid. See
<A HREF="http://datathon.lider-project.eu">http://datathon.lider-project.eu</A>

The SD-LLOD datathon has the main goal of giving people from industry and
academia practical  knowledge in the field of Linked Data applied to
Linguistics. The final aim is to allow participants to migrate their own
(or other&#8217;s) linguistic data and publish them as Linked Data on the Web.
This datathon is the first one organized in this topic worldwide and is
supported by the LIDER FP7 Support Action (<A HREF="http://lider-project.eu/">http://lider-project.eu/</A>). There
will be monetary prizes for the best projects.

During the datathon, participants will:

* Generate and publish their own Linguistic Linked Data from some existing
data source.

* Apply Linked Data principles and Semantic Web technologies (Ontologies,
RDF, Linked Data) into the field of language resources.

* Use the principal models used for representing Linguistic Linked Data, in
particular lemon and NIF.

* Perform Multilingual Word Sense Disambiguation and Entity Linking for the
Web of Data.

* Demonstrate potential benefits and applications of Linguistic Linked Data
for specific use cases.

The program of the summer datathon will contain three types of sessions:

1. Seminars to show novel aspects and discuss selected topics.

2. Practical sessions to introduce the basic foundations of each topic,
methods, and technologies and where participants will perform different
tasks using the methods and technologies presented.

3. Hacking sessions, where participants will follow the whole process of
generating and publishing Linguistic Linked Data with some existing data
set.

Participants are expected to bring to the datathon some data set of
linguistic data produced by their organizations in order to work on it
during the hacking sessions and transformed into Linked Data. For
participants who cannot provide their own linguistic data set, the
organisers will provide one.

Confirmed Invited Speakers

==================

Rodolfo Maslias (Head of Unit Terminology Coordination, European Parliament)

Piek Vossen (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam)

Christian Chiarcos (Goethe-University, Frankfurt)

Marta Villegas (Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona)


Registration

============

Participants are expected to submit a short description (no more than 500
words) of their work and the resources they plan to work with during the
datathon. The cost of the datathon is sponsored by the LIDER project, which
includes accommodation and meals of participants. However there will be an
administrative fee of 50&#8364; for registering in the datathon. A limited amount
of travelling grants will be available for attendants from less-developed
countries who cannot cover their trip with other funds. Registration will
be closed on 15th March.
