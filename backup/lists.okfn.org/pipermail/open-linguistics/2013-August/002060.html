<PRE>=== Call for Participation ===

2nd Workshop on Linked Data in Linguistics (LDL-2013): Representing and 
linking lexicons, terminologies and other language data

<A HREF="http://ldl2013.org/">http://ldl2013.org/</A>

Collocated with the Conference on Generative Approaches to the Lexicon, 
September 23rd in Pisa, Italy

<A HREF="http://glcon2013.org/">http://glcon2013.org/</A>

=== Motivation ===

The explosion of information technology has led to a substantial growth 
in quantity, diversity and complexity of linguistic data accessible over 
the world wide web. The lack of interoperability between linguistic and 
language resources represents a major challenge that needs to be 
addressed, in particular, if information from different sources is to be 
combined, like, say, machine-readable lexicons, corpus data and 
terminology repositories. For these types of resources, domain- specific 
standards have been proposed, yet, issues of interoperability between 
different types of resources persist, commonly accepted strategies to 
distribute, access and integrate their information have yet to be 
established, and technologies and infrastructures to address both 
aspects are still under development.

The goal of the workshop is to bring together researchers from various 
fields of linguistics, natural language processing, and information 
technology and computer science to present and discuss principles, case 
studies and best practices for representing, publishing and linking 
linguistic data collections, including corpora, dictionaries, lexical 
networks, translation memories, thesauri, etc., infrastructures 
developed on that basis, their use of existing standards, and the 
publication and distribution policies that were adopted.

The intended audience includes computational linguists and NLP engineers 
interested in the application of Semantic Web formalisms and related 
technologies to language data, empirically-working linguists and 
lexicographers interested in the representation, exchange and 
interlinking of linguistic data and metadata, and developers of 
infrastructures for linguistic data and other researchers with an 
interest in both aspects.
