<PRE> Dear colleagues, 

Please accept my apologies if you receive this information more than once.

We would like to invite you to send your contributions to the Fifth Workshop on Semantic Deep Learning (SemDeep-5) and participate in the WiC challenge collocated with ICJAI this year. 

Kind regards,
SemDeep organizers

CALL FOR PAPERS FOR THE 5TH WORKSHOP ON SEMANTIC DEEP LEARNING
<A HREF="https://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-linguistics">SemDeep-5 at IJCAI</A> 2019

Macau, China

Semantic Web (SW) technologies and Deep Learning (DL) share the goal of creating intelligent artifacts. Both disciplines have had a remarkable impact in data and knowledge analysis, as well as knowledge representation, and in fact constitute two complementary directions for modeling linguistic phenomena and solving semantically complex problems. In this context, and following the main foundations set in past editions, SemDeep-5 aims to bring together SW and DL research as well as industrial communities. SemDeep-5 is interested in contributions of DL to classic problems in semantic applications, such as: (semi-automated) ontology learning, ontology alignment, ontology annotation, duplicate recognition, ontology prediction, knowledge base completion, relation extraction, and semantically grounded inference, among many others. At the same time, we invite contributions that analyse the interaction of SW technologies and resources with DL architectures, such as knowledge-based embeddings, collocation discovery and classification, or lexical entailment, to name only a few. This workshop seeks to provide an invigorating environment where semantically challenging problems which appeal to both Semantic Web and Computational Linguistic communities are addressed and discussed.

We invite submissions on any approach combining Semantic Web technologies and Deep Learning and suggest the following topics.

Structured knowledge in deep learning.

neural networks and logic rules for semantic compositionality
learning and applying knowledge graph embeddings to NLP tasks
learning semantic similarity and encoding distances as knowledge graph
ontology-based text classification
multilingual resources for neural representations of linguistics
semantic role labeling

Reasoning and inferences and deep learning

commonsense reasoning and vector space models
reasoning with deep learning methods
learning knowledge representations with deep learning
deep learning methods for knowledge-base completion
deep ontology learning
deep learning models for learning knowledge representations from text
deep learning ontological annotations

IMPORTANT DATES

Submission deadline: Apr 26, 2019
Notification of acceptance: May 17, 2019
Camera-ready version: June 1, 2019
Workshop dates: Co-located with IJCAI (10-16 August 2019). Exact date to be announced soon.

SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

We invite three types of submissions:

- Long papers (max. 6 pages)
- Short papers presenting innovative not fully empirically validated ideas or position papers (max. 4 pages)
- Short system description papers for the challenge (max. 4 pages)

All papers need to follow the IJCAI formatting guidelines. One extra page for references for all types of submission.

=======================================================================

WiC Challenge

The workshop includes a challenge (shared task) on evaluating contextualized word representations. The task is based on the WiC dataset (<A HREF="https://pilehvar.github.io/wic/">https://pilehvar.github.io/wic/</A> &lt;<A HREF="https://pilehvar.github.io/wic/">https://pilehvar.github.io/wic/</A>&gt;, NAACL 2019) and targets different areas of lexical semantics including, but not limited to, sense representation, word sense disambiguation, and contextualised word embeddings. Training, development and test data will be provided for the participants. 

More information about the challenge and how to participate can be found at <A HREF="https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/20010">https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/20010</A> &lt;<A HREF="https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/20010">https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/20010</A>&gt;. Important dates are shown below. 

WiC Challenge dates:

Data available, evaluation start: 12 March 2019
Evaluation end: 12 April 2019
Submission of short system description paper: 26 April 2019
