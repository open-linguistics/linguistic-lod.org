1st International Workshop on Semantic Web for Historical and Legacy
Linguistic and Lexicographic Data (
<A HREF="https://www.computing.dcu.ie/~rhaque/workshop/index.html">https://www.computing.dcu.ie/~rhaque/workshop/index.html</A>) to be held in
conjunction with International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC 2019:
<A HREF="https://iswc2019.semanticweb.org/">https://iswc2019.semanticweb.org/</A>) Auckland, New Zealand from October
26-27, 2019.

Workshop Description:

Historical, legacy and indigenous language resources are becoming available
on the web in response to open access policies adopted by public and
private research institutions. Legacy data of historical, cultural and
linguistic importance has a significant role in supporting the research
endeavour of fellow scientists across different domains. This emerging
trend presents a new challenge for the institutions on how to efficiently
open up their legacy data to deliver semantically rich, interlinked and
interoperable dataset. Ontologies provide semantics to enrich such
resources and serve the basis for publishing such data using Linked Open
Data(LOD) platforms. However, existing ontologies and platforms do not
provide comprehensive coverage to domain-specific requirements of the
institutions and the target users. This trend further provides a new
opportunity to bridge the among domain digital humanity researchers,
linguists, NLP practitioners and computer scientists by making rich
domain-specific models to semantically uplift the collections, efficiently
interlink the resources using LOD principles and enhance the discovery of
the resources by human users and computer agents. To this end, it becomes
very crucial for both institutional and individual users to come together
to discuss and share the experiences on the semantic publishing of legacy
data on the LOD platforms.

Many historical, socio-cultural and linguistic research centres, national
archives and museums are adopting open access policy to promote efficient
utilisation of their resources by the general public. However, much of the
legacy data lacks detailed semantics to be used and exploited by non-expert
users. Semantic web technologies are capable of enriching the data with
required semantics, however, existing ontologies and available models do
not fully support the domain-specific requirements of users.

As institutions plan to make public records accessible to the general
public, more and more domain-specific information will become available and
linking such data in the LOD cloud will attract significant attention.
Thus, opening a discussion platform that brings various stakeholders such
as digital humanity experts, linguists, NLP experts, computer scientist and
ontology engineers together to present their work and share their
experiences is of paramount importance.


Topics:
We are interested in a wide range of semantic web topics which are of
relevance for digital humanities, history and language in general.

Representation and modelling of cultural, literacy, historical and legacy
language resources and linguistic data

&#8211; Semantic modelling and representation of legacy Linguistic Linked Open
Data (LLOD).
&#8211; Ontologies for modelling language resources.
&#8211; Semantic representation of lexicographic resources.
&#8211; Semantic annotation, enrichment and use of multilingual lexicographic
resources.
&#8211; Ontology development, alignment and mapping for representing language
resources including
monolingual and multilingual dictionaries, thesaurus, etc.
&#8211; Ontologies for representing the evolution of linguistic resources.
&#8211; Ontologies for representing the life cycle of legacy language resources
from collection to publication to use.
&#8211; Semantic exploration method of cultural, historical and legacy texts.
&#8211; Ontologies for representing cultural, historical and legacy speech data.
