AIMS:

&#160;

SLSP is a yearly conference series aimed at promoting and displaying excellent research on the wide spectrum of statistical methods that are currently in use in computational language or speech processing. It aims at attracting contributions from both fields. Though there exist large conferences and workshops hosting contributions to any of these areas, SLSP is a more focused meeting where synergies between the two domains will hopefully happen. In SLSP 2019, significant room will be reserved to young scholars at the beginning of their career and particular focus will be put on methodology.

&#160;
VENUE:
