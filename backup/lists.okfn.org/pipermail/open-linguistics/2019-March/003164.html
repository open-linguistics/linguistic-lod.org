INVITED TUTORS:

Michel Dumontier (Maastricht University, NL)
Marieke van Erp (KNAW Humanities Cluster, Netherlands)

The International Semantic Web Research School (ISWS) is a full immersion,
super intensive one-week experience including lectures and keynotes from
outstanding speakers, a &#8220;learning by doing&#8221; teamwork program on open
research problems, under the guidance of the best scientists in the field,
with whom you will co-author a white paper of high potential impact. ISWS
means networking and becoming friends with your peers as well as senior
scientists, and have lots of fun with them. At ISWS we shape the future
generation of semantic web researchers with creativity, methodology, fun
and rigour.


ISWS provides a perfect experience for young scientists and researchers,
working in both academia and industry, who want to learn about cutting edge
technologies and novel research achievements at the crossing point between
Artificial Intelligence and the Semantic Web domain. The school inherits
the successful pedagogic principles and the lessons learned from previous
experiences and is a prominent reference school for the best young
researchers, PhD, and master students of the Semantic Web community.

ISWS takes place in the beautiful location of Bertinoro, a small village
near Bologna in Italy and relies on the organisation of its directors
Valentina Presutti from CNR and Harald Sack from FIZ Karlsruhe and KIT.
ISWS is focused on research and its program includes lectures, invited
talks, poster session, team working, and an exciting social program. All
tutors and speakers of the school are renown members of the Semantic Web
community and beyond. Students work very hard for a whole week and
experience all main activities that a researcher faces during her/his
career such as team working, problem and state of the art analysis,
development of novel methods, writing of research articles and reports,
presenting a research result, and also defending a thesis. ISWS combines
the format of a research camp with lectures and keynote talks. To
facilitate an early exchange of ideas and mentoring opportunity a poster
session will also take place, where attendees will have the chance to
present their work and obtain feedback on their research.

The school is an exceptional opportunity for networking: all tutors stay
and constantly interact with the students for the whole duration of the
school. The result is that participants, typically at an early career
stage, thanks to the school, build a rich social and professional network
that span from junior to highly known scientists. Although ISWS features
lectures and keynotes, most of the time is devoted to work in team with the
tutors for developing research. Students form teams and focus on a research
problem for which they study a solution under the methodological guidance
of highly expert tutors. The program also introduces competition among
students, as prizes are awarded at the end of the week.

ISWS is organised so that students have lots of fun during social
activities and free time. They leave the school with great memories and
satisfaction, and by having met many new good friends.

Participating at ISWS 2019 means to benefit from formal and practical
sessions as well as from informal and social interactions with established
researchers and the other participants to the school.

HOW TO APPLY

We welcome applicants from anywhere in the world. Normally, but not
exclusively, applicants will be early stage PhD students, post graduate
students/practitioners, master students and junior post doc researchers in
relevant disciplines with some knowledge of semantic and web technologies.
Some basic acquaintance with knowledge representation languages for the
Semantic Web (RDF, OWL, etc.) is required.

The deadline for applications is the April 4th 2019. Please follow the
instructions at the &#8220;Apply&#8221; menu of <A HREF="http://www.semanticwebschool.org/.">http://www.semanticwebschool.org/.</A>

Accepted candidates are expected to arrive on Sunday, June 30th, between
3pm and 6pm and to participate fully in the activities of the school
including social and training activities until its conclusion, at 2pm on
Saturday, July 6th (meaning that your return flight cannot be scheduled
before 5pm). Applicants should keep in mind that we will not consider
applications from students who cannot commit themselves to a full
participation for the whole duration of the school. Students are also
required to bring and present a poster at the summer school, describing
their own research work.

Apart from activities directly related to lectures, the summer school
schedule features a rich social programme, which enables informal
interaction between all participants to the school - i.e. students, tutors,
invited speakers, school staff, etc. These events include a gala dinner, a
disco, and sport activities.

STUDENT GRANTS
A separate call for grant applications will be published, only for those
who have already applied. We expect to provide a number of grants for
students who would not otherwise be able to attend the school. More details
about student grants will be published later.

VENUE AND ACCOMMODATION
ISWS 2019 will be located at the University Residential Center located in
the small medieval hilltop town of Bertinoro. This town is in Emilia
Romagna, about 50 km east of Bologna at an elevation of 230m above sea
level. It can easily be reached by train and taxi from Bologna.

Bertinoro is picturesque, with many narrow streets and walkways winding
around the central peak. Sessions of the summer school will be held in an
archiepiscopal castle that has been converted by the University of Bologna
into a modern conference centre with computing facilities and Internet
access.  From the castle you can enjoy a beautiful vista that stretches
from the Tuscan Apennines to the Adriatic coast and the Alps over the Po
Valley.

More information about the location are available at the &#8220;Venue&#8221; page on
<A HREF="http://www.semanticwebschool.org/">http://www.semanticwebschool.org/</A>
The summer school fee is 970&#8364; and includes school material, accommodation,
meals (including the gala dinner), excursion and other social activities.
It does not include traveling costs. Two shuttles (at fixed times) will be
organised from Bologna airport and bus station to the school.
