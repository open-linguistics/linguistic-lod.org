2019)
                The Helix, DCU, Dublin, August 20, 2019
                 <A HREF="https://sites.google.com/view/loresmt/">https://sites.google.com/view/loresmt/</A>

BRIEF

1. Call for papers: Submission due on &quot;May 24, 2019&quot;

2. Please find below the proceeding and slides of LoResMT 2018. Works on
several low resource languages, e.g. Filipino, Finnish, Irish, Latvian,
Mongolian, Quechua, Tibetan, and Uyghur, are presented.

SCOPES

Machine translation (MT) technologies have been improved significantly in
the last two decades, with the developments on phrased-based statistical MT
(SMT) and recently the neural MT (NMT). However, most of these methods rely
on the availability of large parallel data (millions to tens of millions
sentence pairs) in the training, which are resources that do not exist in
many language pairs.

In addition, MT methods still rely on a few natural language processing
(NLP) tools to help pre-process human generated texts in the forms that are
required as input for these methods, and/or post-process the output in
proper textual forms in target languages. In many MT systems, the
performance of these tools has great impacts on the quality of the
resulting translation. These NLP tools include, but not limited to, several
kinds of word tokenizers/de-tokenizers, word segmenters, morphology
analyzers, etc.

The workshop solicits papers on MT systems/methods for low resource
languages in general. We also solicit papers dedicated to these
supplementary NLP tools that are used in any language and especially in low
resource languages. We would like to have an overview of research on MT for
low resource languages and these NLP tools from our community.

TOPICS

We solicit original research papers, review papers, and position papers on
MT research for low resource languages in the workshop. Multilingual and/or
cross-lingual NLP tools for low resource languages are especially welcome.
Topics of the workshop include but are not limited to:

- Research and review papers of pre-processing and/or post-processing NLP
tools for MT
- Position papers on the development of pre-processing and/or
post-processing tools for MT
- Word tokenizers/de-tokenizers for specific languages
- Word/morpheme segmenters for specific languages
- Alignment/Re-ordering tools for specific language pairs
- Use of morphology analysers and/or morpheme segmenters in MT
- Multilingual/cross-lingual NLP tools for MT
- Re-usability of existing NLP tools for low resource languages
- Corpora creation and curation technologies for low resource languages
- Review of available parallel corpora for low resource languages
- Research and review papers of MT methods for low resource languages
- MT systems/methods (e.g. rule-based, PBMT, NMT) for low resource languages
- Pivot MT for low resource languages
- Zero-shot MT for low resource languages
- Fast building of MT systems for low resource languages
- Reusability of existing MT systems for low resource languages
- Machine translation for language preservation

SUBMISSION INFORMATION

Workshop papers should adhere to MT Summit 2019 style guide (LaTeX,
OpenOffice, Word).
<A HREF="https://www.mtsummit2019.com/submissions">https://www.mtsummit2019.com/submissions</A>

There are two types of submissions in the workshop. For research, review
and position papers, the length of each paper should be at least four (4)
and not exceed eight (8) pages, plus unlimited pages for references. More
pages would be allowed as long as it could be justified. The review will be
double-blinded. For non-archival system demonstration abstracts, the limit
is four (4) pages. The review will be single-blind.

We would like to encourage authors to cite papers written in ANY language
that are related to the topics, as long as both original bibliographic
items and their corresponding English translations are provided.
