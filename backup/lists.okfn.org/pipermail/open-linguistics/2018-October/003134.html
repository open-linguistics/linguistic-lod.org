<PRE>First Call for Papers Biographical Data in a Digital World 2019
Varna (Bulgaria)
5-6 September 2019
<A HREF="https://sites.google.com/view/bd2019">https://sites.google.com/view/bd2019</A>

The digital age has changed the way academics work in every discipline. Computers allow for the processing of digital
data much faster than humans can do, they are able to show patterns and statistical analyses and can detect links that
otherwise would be hard to find. This conference explores whether and how, in the field of digital humanities,
biographical data are special. Biographies are interesting for analysis with computer techniques, since individuals share a
set of common characteristics that can be relatively easily identified by a machine, such as a birthdate, a partner, a
profession, and a network. Tools and approaches from the digital humanities can be used for both quantitative analyses
of such data and for providing leads for more qualitative research questions.

This conference aims at bringing together researchers from both the humanities and the computer sciences to exchange
experiences, methods and practices with respect to ICT mediated quantitative and qualitative analysis of biographical
data. What can we do already with computational methods with the huge amount of digital biographical data that is
available? What will we be able to do in the future? What will we not be able to do?

For this edition we invite both full paper submissions and abstracts.

Papers must have a maximum of 8.000 words (excluding bibliography and footnotes) and minimum of 3000 words, which
will undergo a single blind peer review process. Accepted papers will be published in online proceedings shortly after the
Conference.

Abstracts will be checked for relevance. Accepted abstracts will be welcome to give a presentation at the Conference, and
will be included in a book of abstracts.

Topics which may be addressed include, but certainly are not limited to:

1.      Mining biographies for structured information
2.      Biographies and linked data
3.      Using biographical information for quantitative analyses
4.      The canonization of people and events in history
5.      The use or uselessness of big data for biographical research
6.      Visualizing biographical data
7.      Biographical Dictionaries
8.      Dealing with biographical data in heterogeneous datasets
9.      Practices in digitizing and converting biographical data to a software interpretable format
10.    Automatic biography generation
11.    Biographies across countries and cultures
12.    Standards, vocabularies and best practices for the encoding and processing of biographical data

Deadline for full paper submissions: 15 May 2019, 08:00 GMT.
Deadline for abstracts: 21 June 2019, 08:00 GMT.
