ESWC 2019 features four main tracks (Research, In-Use, Resources and Industry), and recently switched to an open and transparent review policy (see below).

Submission Information
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ** * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 

ESWC 2019 welcomes the submission of original research and application papers dealing with all aspects of representing and using semantic technologies on the Web. We encourage theoretical, methodological, empirical, and applications papers. Submitted papers should describe original work, present significant results, and provide rigorous, principled, and repeatable evaluation.

We strongly encourage and appreciate the submission of papers incorporating links to data sets and other material used for evaluation as well as to demos and software source code.

ESWC will not accept papers that, at the time of submission, are under review for or have already been published in or accepted for publication in a journal, another conference, or another ESWC track. The conference organizers may share information on submissions with other venues to ensure that this rule is not violated.

The proceedings of this conference will be published in Springer&#8217;s Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. 

Guidelines Include
	- Pre-submission of abstracts is a strict requirement. All papers and abstracts have to be submitted electronically via the EasyChair conference submission system &lt;<A HREF="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eswc2019papers">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eswc2019papers</A>&gt;. Abstracts alone will not be reviewed.
	- Papers must not exceed 15 pages (including references). Papers that exceed the page limit will be rejected without review.
	- All research submissions must be in English.
	- Submissions must be either in PDF or in HTML, formatted in the style of the Springer Publications format for Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS). For details on the LNCS style, see Springer&#8217;s Author Instructions &lt;<A HREF="https://www.springer.com/us/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines">https://www.springer.com/us/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines</A>&gt;  For HTML submission guidance, see the HTML submission guide &lt;<A HREF="https://2019.eswc-conferences.org/html-submission-guide/">https://2019.eswc-conferences.org/html-submission-guide/</A>&gt;.
	- We encourage embedding metadata in the PDF/HTML to provide a machine readable link from the paper to the resource.
	- Authors will have the opportunity to submit a rebuttal to the reviews to clarify questions posed by program committee members.
	- Authors of accepted papers will be required to provide semantic annotations for the abstract of their submission, which will be made available on the conference web site. Details will be provided at the time of acceptance.
	- Accepted papers will be distributed to conference attendees and also published by Springer in the printed conference proceedings, as part of the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.
	- At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the conference and present the paper there.

Open and Transparent Review Policy
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ** * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 

The ESWC 2019 review process will be open, i.e., the papers and reviews will be made web-available, and transparent, i.e., (meta) reviewer names will be made available as well together with the decision process such as the authors&#8217; rebuttal. The basic principles are:

	- All submitted papers, reviews, rebuttals, meta-reviews, and decisions will be publicly posted on the ESWC 2019 web site upon final notification, including reviewer names. Comments, revisions to reviews (aside of the main update after the rebuttal) as well as confidential remarks to SPC will not be published.
	- The authors will be known to reviewers (i.e., submissions are NOT anonymous)
	- SPC and PC members will be made public by default after final notification. However, PC members can also explicitly opt-out. 
	- If requested by the authors, papers and their reviews will be removed from the ESWC 2019 Website 4 weeks after the notification deadline.
	- Reviewers of accepted papers will appear in the header of accepted papers (see here for an example: <A HREF="http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/issues#2018">http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/issues#2018</A> &lt;<A HREF="http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/issues#2018">http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/issues#2018</A>&gt;)
