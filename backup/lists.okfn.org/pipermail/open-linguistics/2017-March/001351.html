&#160;
INTERNATIONAL SUMMER SCHOOL ON DEEP LEARNING

&#160;
DeepLearn 2017

&#160;
Bilbao, Spain

&#160;
July 17-21, 2017

&#160;

Organized by:

University of Deusto

Rovira i Virgili University

&#160;

&#160;

************************************************************

&#160;
--- Early registration deadline: March 24, 2017 ---

&#160;

********************************************************

&#160;
SCOPE:

&#160;

DeepLearn 2017 will be a research training event with a global scope aiming at updating participants about the most recent advances in the critical and fast developing area of deep learning. This is a branch of artificial intelligence covering a spectrum of current exciting machine learning research and industrial innovation that provides more efficient algorithms to deal with large-scale data in neuroscience, computer vision, speech recognition, language processing, drug discovery, biomedical informatics, recommender systems, learning theory, robotics, games, etc. Renowned academics and industry pioneers will lecture and share their views with the audience.

&#160;

Most deep learning subareas will be displayed, and main challenges identified through 4 keynote lectures, 30 six-hour courses, and 1 round table, which will tackle the most active and promising topics. The organizers are convinced that outstanding speakers will attract the brightest and most motivated students. Interaction will be a main component of the event. An open session will give participants the opportunity to present their own work in progress in 5 minutes.

&#160;
ADDRESSED TO:

&#160;

In principle, graduate students, doctoral students and postdocs will be typical profiles of participants. However, there are no formal pre-requisites for attendance in terms of academic degrees. Since there will be a variety of levels, specific knowledge background may be assumed for some of the courses. DeepLearn 2017 is also appropriate for more senior academics and practitioners who want to keep themselves updated on recent developments and future trends. All will surely find it fruitful to listen and discuss with major researchers, industry leaders and innovators.

&#160;
REGIME:

&#160;

In addition to keynotes, 3-4 courses will run in parallel during the whole event. Participants will be able to freely choose the courses they wish to attend as well as to move from one to another.

&#160;
VENUE:

&#160;

DeepLearn 2017 will take place in Bilbao, the largest city in the Basque Country, famous for its gastronomy and the seat of the Guggenheim Museum. The venue will be:

&#160;
