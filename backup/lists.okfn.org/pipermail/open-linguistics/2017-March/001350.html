=======================


The 2nd Summer Datathon on Linguistic Linked Open Data (SD-LLOD-17) will be
held from June 26th to 30th 2017 at Residencia Lucas Olaz&#225;bal of
Universidad Polit&#233;cnica de Madrid, Cercedilla, Madrid. See
<A HREF="http://datathon2017.retele.linkeddata.es">http://datathon2017.retele.linkeddata.es</A>

The SD-LLOD datathon has the main goal of giving people from industry and
academia practical  knowledge in the field of Linked Data applied to
Linguistics. The final aim is to allow participants to migrate their own
(or other&#8217;s) linguistic data and publish them as Linked Data on the Web.
This datathon series is unique in its topic worldwide and continues from
the success of the event two years ago (see <A HREF="http://datathon.lider-project.">http://datathon.lider-project.</A>
eu/).

During the datathon, participants will:

* Generate and publish their own linguistic linked data from some existing
data source.

* Apply Linked Data principles and Semantic Web technologies (Ontologies,
RDF, Linked Data) into the field of language resources.

* Use the principal models used for representing linguistic linked data, in
particular OntoLex-Lemon and NIF.

* Perform Multilingual Word Sense Disambiguation and Entity Linking for the
Web of Data.

* Learn about potential benefits and applications of linguistic linked data
for specific use cases.

The program of the summer datathon will contain three types of sessions:

1. Seminars to show novel aspects and discuss selected topics.

2. Practical sessions to introduce the basic foundations of each topic,
methods, and technologies and where participants will perform different
tasks using the methods and technologies presented.

3. Hacking sessions, where participants will follow the whole process of
generating and publishing Linguistic Linked Data with some existing data
set.

Participants will be invited to propose a &#8220;miniproject&#8221; related to the
topic and to bring to the datathon some dataset of linguistic data produced
by their organizations in order to work on it during the hacking sessions
and transform it into linked data. Participants who cannot provide their
own linguistic dataset can join another&#8217;s miniproject or some of the ones
proposed by the organisers. There will be an award to the best miniproject.

Invited Speakers

==================

Ilan Kernerman  (K Dictionaries)

Laurette Pretorius (University of South Africa)

Elena Gonz&#225;lez-Blanco (Universidad Nacional de Educaci&#243;n a Distancia)

Angus Roberts (University of Sheffield)

Penny Labropoulou  (ILSP, RC Athena)

Registration

============

Participants will be invited to submit a short abstract of their ideas for
the datathon (description of possible resources to be converted, linked or
reused during the datathon, ideas for use cases, etc.). A selection of them
will be presented in a poster session during the event and might be
proposed as miniprojects to be developed during the datathon. Registration
will be closed on 4th April (deadline extended).
