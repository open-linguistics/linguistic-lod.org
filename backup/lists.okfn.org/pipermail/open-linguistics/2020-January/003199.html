WILDRE &#8211; the 5th workshop on Indian Language Data: Resources and Evaluation
is being organized in Marseille (France) on 16th May 2020 under the LREC
platform. India has a huge linguistic diversity and has seen concerted
efforts from the Indian government and industry towards developing language
resources. European Language Resource Association (ELRA) and its associate
organizations have been very active and successful in addressing the
challenges and opportunities related to language resource creation and
evaluation. It is, therefore, a great opportunity for resource creators of
Indian languages to showcase their work on this platform and also to
interact and learn from those involved in similar initiatives all over the
world. In addition to research papers, WILDRE-5 is going to organize *shared
task on &#8220;Universal Dependency based Indian Language Parser*&#8221; (the details
will be shared very soon on the workshop website). The broader objectives
of the WILDRE will be

   -

   To map the status of Indian Language Resources
   -

   To investigate challenges related to creating and sharing various levels
   of language resources
   -

   To promote a dialogue between language resource developers and users
   -

   To provide an opportunity for researchers from India to collaborate with
   researchers from other parts of the world

We are seeking submissions under the following category

   -

   Full papers (10 pages)
   -

   Short papers (work in progress &#8211; 5 pages)
   -

   Posters (innovative ideas/proposals, a research proposal of students)
   -

   Demo (of working online/standalone systems)

WILDRE-5 will have a special focus on Demos of Indian Language Technology.
In the past few years, as more resources have been developed and made
available, there has been increased activity in developing usable
technology using these. WILDRE-5 would like to encourage and widen the Demo
track to allow the community to showcase their demos and have mutually
beneficial interactions with each other as well as resource developers.

WILRE-5 will invite technical, policy and position paper submissions on the
following topics related to Indian Language Resources:

   -

   Digital Humanities, heritage computing
   -

   Corpora - text, speech, multimodal, methodologies, annotation and tools
   -

   Lexicons and Machine-readable dictionaries
   -

   Ontologies, Grammars
   -

   Language resources for basic NLP, IR, Machine Translation and Speech
   Technology tasks, tools and Infrastructure for constructing and sharing
   language resources
   -

   Standards or specifications for language resources applications
   -

   Licensing and copyright issues

Both submission and review processes handled electronically. The review
process will be *double-blind*. The workshop website will provide the
submission guidelines and the link for the electronic submission.

When submitting a paper from the START page (
&lt;<A HREF="https://www.softconf.com/lrec2020/WILDRE-5/">https://www.softconf.com/lrec2020/WILDRE-5/</A>&gt;
<A HREF="https://www.softconf.com/lrec2020/WILDRE-5/">https://www.softconf.com/lrec2020/WILDRE-5/</A>), authors will be asked to
provide essential information about resources (in a broad sense, i.e. also
technologies, standards, evaluation kits, etc.) that have been used for the
work described in the paper or are a new result of your research. Moreover,
ELRA encourages all LREC authors to share the described LRs (data, tools,
services, etc.), to enable their reuse, replicability of experiments,
including evaluation ones, etc.
