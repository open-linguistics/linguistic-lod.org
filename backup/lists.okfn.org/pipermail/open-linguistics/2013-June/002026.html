<PRE>Countdown for the first part of the 15th Discovery Challenge - 
Recommending Given Names


organized in conjunction with ECML PKDD 2013

September 23rd to 27th, 2013, Prague, Czech Republic


All over the world, future parents are facing the task of finding 
suitable given names for their children. This choice is influenced by 
different factors, such as the social context, language, cultural 
background and especially personal taste. Typically, parents spent hours 
with browsing through endless lists of names, hoping to find the perfect 
name.

LET&#8217;S HELP THEM!

====================================================================

Countdown for the offline challenge:  ONLY TEN DAYS TO GO!

====================================================================

If you already participate in the challenge: keep on submitting improved 
recommendations. If you didn&#8217;t yet participate in the challenge and you 
have your recommendation approach at hand: Don&#8217;t miss the opportunity to 
show your recommender&#8217;s performance in this new setting!

As the deadline of the offline challenge steadily approaches, we will 
publish additional leaderboards within the next ten days. Altogether, 
four leaderboards will be published until the end of the offline challenge:

* Friday, June 21st

* Monday, June 24th

* Wednesday, June 26th

* Friday, June 28th

The leaderboard will be based on the latest submissions until 14:00h 
(CET) of the respective date.

Your final submission is due on July 1st, 23:59h (HAST - Hawaii-Aleutian 
Standard Time). As this challenge aims at getting new insights into the 
task of recommending names, all participants are requested to submit a 
workshop paper (due July 8th) which describes the applied recommendation 
approach. Based on the final submission&#8217;s performance, the winner of the 
offline challenge will be announced on July 15th, given a sound 
presentation in the submitted workshop paper.

On the same day, the second part of the challenge starts (about three 
weeks from now): Integrate a live name recommender in the running name 
search platform Nameling (<A HREF="http://nameling.net">http://nameling.net</A>). To win the offline 
challenge it is not mandatory to take part in the online challenge, 
although all participants are welcome to integrate their recommender 
algorithms into the live system. We are currently testing the technical 
setup of the name recommendation challenge and we will shortly publish 
the detailed description.

For more information regarding participation, task description and 
access to the data please check the official 20DC13-Callenge-Website:
