<PRE>Call for Papers for the Bio-Ontologies Community of Special Interest (COSI)
co-located with Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB)
July 24-25, 2017 in Prague, Czech Republic
** NEW Submission Deadline: April 20th, 2017  **

Bio-Ontologies (<A HREF="http://www.bio-ontologies.org.uk&lt;http://www.bio-ontologies.org.uk/">http://www.bio-ontologies.org.uk&lt;http://www.bio-ontologies.org.uk/</A>&gt;) is an ISMB Community of Special Interest (COSI)&lt;<A HREF="https://www.iscb.org/iscb-cosis">https://www.iscb.org/iscb-cosis</A>&gt; that covers the latest and most innovative research in the application of ontologies and more generally the organisation, presentation and dissemination of knowledge in biomedicine and the life sciences.

Bio-Ontologies is celebrating its 20th year at ISMB in 2017, which will be held in Prague, Czech Republic July 21-25, 2017. It continues to provide a vibrant environment for reporting novel methods and sharing experiences on the construction and application of ontologies in health care and the life sciences. The informal nature of the event offers a constructive environment to nurture discussion of innovative and scientifically sound work that range from preliminary to completed, from both young and experienced investigators alike. Bio-Ontologies participants also benefit from a strongly interdisciplinary setting, where ISMB attendees intermingle with members from American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA)&lt;<A HREF="https://www.amia.org/">https://www.amia.org/</A>&gt; and the W3C&#8217;s Healthcare and Life Sciences interest group (HCLSIG)&lt;<A HREF="https://www.w3.org/blog/hcls/">https://www.w3.org/blog/hcls/</A>&gt;, thereby increasing impact through broader dissemination and enabling new and exceptional collaborations.

  *   Platforms for Biocuration
  *   Automated Annotation Pipelines
  *   Knowledge representation and knowledge discovery for biomedical data
  *   Use of semantic technologies in text mining
  *   Ontology growth, mapping and repair
  *   Efforts to generate and assess FAIR data
  *   Social, moral and technical issues in publishing and consuming biomedical and life sciences data.
  *   Research in Ontology Engineering and Ontology Evaluation
  *   Flash updates on Newly Developed or Existing Bio-Ontologies

Deadlines and Presentation Length
We welcome short research papers (4 pages), flash updates (1 page) and poster abstracts (1 page) as a PDF using the Bio-ontologies template for papers (<A HREF="https://goo.gl/KD7Bmi">https://goo.gl/KD7Bmi</A>) or updates/posters (<A HREF="https://goo.gl/1OkQSH">https://goo.gl/1OkQSH</A>). Submissions can be made on the easychair site (<A HREF="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=bioontologies2017">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=bioontologies2017</A>). Please note that accepted submissions require that one author present the work. The research presentations are normally allocated between 20-25 minutes while flash updates are presented in 5-10 minutes. The presenter must register and pay to attend the conference and the presenter should identify themselves as the corresponding author during the submission process.
