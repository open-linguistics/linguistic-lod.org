FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS

The 7th Joint International Semantic Technology Conference (JIST 2017)

<A HREF="http://ict.griffith.edu.au/aist/jist2017">http://ict.griffith.edu.au/aist/jist2017</A>

November 10-12, 2017 (Fri - Sun)
Gold Coast, Australia


The mission of the Joint International Semantic Technology Conference
(JIST) is to
bring together researchers in Semantic Technology research community and
other areas
of semantic related technologies to present their innovative research
results or
novel applications of semantic technologies.

In this announcement:
1. Important Dates
2. Recommendation to SCI Journals
3. Call for Papers
4. Submission Guide
5. Organization

=============================================================

1. Important Dates

- Abstract submission: 23:59 (Hawaii Time), August 1, 2017
- Full paper submission: 23:59 (Hawaii Time), August 8, 2017
- Notification of Acceptance: September 8, 2017
- Camera-ready Deadline: September 25, 2017
- Conference: November 10-12, 2017

=============================================================

2. Recommendation to SCI Journals

A number of best papers accepted at JIST 2017 will be invited to present at
the
Meet the Editor session of SCI indexed journals, including International
Journal
on Semantic Web and Information Systems (IJSWIS), for fast-track
publication in a
special issue in these journals. Up to five papers will be selected and
published.
An indicative timeline is given below:
- Manuscript revision proposal: mid November 2017
- Submission of revised manuscript: mid January 2018
- Notification of acceptance: mid March 2018
- Publication: second half 2018

=============================================================

3. Call for Papers

--------------------------------------------------------------
Call for Research Track Papers
--------------------------------------------------------------

JIST 2017 research track solicits submissions of original research work on
semantic
technologies. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Ontology and reasoning
- Knowledge Graph
- Linked Data
- Big Data and semantics, exchange and integration
- Data streams and the Internet of Things
- Machine learning and information extraction on the Semantic Web
- Semantic Web services and processes
- Trust, privacy, and security on the Semantic Web
- Social Semantic Web
- Natural language processing and semantics
- Semantic multimedia
- Novel applications of semantic technologies


--------------------------------------------------------------
Call for In-Use Track Papers
--------------------------------------------------------------

Quality shared resources such as public ontologies, datasets and software
are highly
valuable to the research community, hence, JIST 2017 in-use track also
calls for
submissions of public, shared resources of interest to the Semantic Web
community.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Description of an implemented application
- Description of concrete problems
- Analysis and evaluation of semantic tools
- Lessons learned and best practices
- Linked Data, open data and vocabularies in production use
- Semantic resources
- Semantic technology in new application domains


--------------------------------------------------------------
Call for Special Track Papers
--------------------------------------------------------------

The philosophy behind Special Tracks is to facilitate the proactive
participation
of researchers from certain fields or communities who have linked the
semantic
technology with their research fields.

Special Tracks accept 8-page short papers that will be reviewed in the same
way
as the Research Track papers and will be included in the Proceedings if
accepted.

In JIST2017, we have a special track on Semantic Processing for Knowledge
Graphs

Semantic technologies such as Linked Data promote publication of various
data and
knowledge on the web with semantic links among them. They form huge sized
knowledge
bases called Knowledge Graphs in a large variety of domains. An important
technical
feature of Knowledge Graphs is their rich semantics. This special track
focuses on
semantics of Knowledge Graphs, especially on how to use their semantics
towards
practical applications.

Topics of interest include but are not limited to:
- Semantic processing and reasoning for Knowledge Graph
- Application using semantics of Knowledge Graph
- Modelling of semantics for Knowledge Graph
- Development of Knowledge Graph (Ontology, Linked Data)


--------------------------------------------------------------
Call for Poster &amp; Demo Papers and Workshop Proposals
--------------------------------------------------------------

JIST 2017 cordially invites you to submit Poster and Demo papers as well as
workshop
proposals. For details please check our website:

=============================================================

4. Submission

Submissions to JIST 2017 should describe original, significant research on
semantic
technologies. JIST 2017 will not accept submissions that are under review
for
or have already been published in or accepted for publication in a journal
or
another conference. Submissions to JIST 2017 are expected to present their
claimed
contribution, with clear evidence to support their claims. All submissions
will be
critically reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. To
assess
submissions, reviewers will judge their relevance to semantic technologies,
their
originality, the technical soundness of their proposed approach and the
readability
of the submission.

JIST 2017 submissions are not anonymous.

Submissions must be in PDF format, using the style of the Springer
Publications
format for Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS). Submissions must be no
longer
than *16* pages for the Research and In-Use Tracks, and no longer than *8*
pages
for the Special Tracks. Submissions that exceed these limits may be
rejected without
review. Submissions to the In-Use Track that are less than 16 pages can be
considered.

Accepted papers will be published in an LNCS proceedings. At least one
author of
each accepted paper must register for the conference and present the paper
there.


Papers can be submitted electronically via
<A HREF="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=jist2017.">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=jist2017.</A>
Please select the corresponding tracks when you submit your paper(s).
