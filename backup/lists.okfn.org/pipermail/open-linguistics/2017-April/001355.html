<PRE>ESWC2017: 28 May to 1 June 2017 in Portoro&#382;, Slovenia
EU project networking track

Do you have a research or innovation project which has results it wants to share?
Requirements it needs fulfilled?

The EU project networking track of ESWC2017 is an unique opportunity for
* Knowledge sharing among research and innovation projects
* Data and technology transfer between collaborators
* Presentation and discussion of project results with ESWC participants
* Discussion about future funding opportunities such as H2020 and ERC

Also, it will include a presentation by a representative of the European Commission on the European Research Council (ERC) and ERC funding schemes.

The project networking track is intended to provide collaborative projects with the ability to connect with each other and engage in discussions about their respective research and development, establish opportunities for knowledge and technology sharing, and identify complementary activities and goals which can form the basis for future collaborations, research proposals, researcher exchange or joint participation at events or in initiatives.
We equally welcome submissions from recently finished projects which have results to transfer and recently started projects which are seeking datasets and tools to perform their work, regardless of whether they are EU, national or regionally funded.

SUBMISSION
Projects willing to participate at the session must submit a 2-page extended abstract (PDF, Springer LNCS style). The abstract should introduce the project, briefly describe its R&amp;D activities and goals and outline what the project would show / demonstrate in the session, focused specifically on what the project plans to offer to other projects and/or wishes to request from other projects. This should be backed up by links to online datasets, tools or use cases where requirements are identified.
Submissions will be evaluated by the Organising Committee. There will be a limited number of places for the best evaluated projects in the networking space. Decisions about acceptance will be based on relevance to ESWC2017, tangible innovation and uniqueness in the R&amp;D activities and a clear goal to benefit from networking with other projects.
Submission link will be announced shortly at <A HREF="http://2017.eswc-conferences.org/call-project-networking">http://2017.eswc-conferences.org/call-project-networking</A>


DEADLINE
&#8211; Abstract submission deadline: April 22th, 2017, 23:59
&#8211; Notification of acceptance/rejection: April 29th, 2017, 23:59
