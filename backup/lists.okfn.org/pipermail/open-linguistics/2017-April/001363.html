<PRE>Sixth International Conference on Future Generation Communication 
Technologies
Irish Computer Soceity, Dublin
Ireland
August 21-23, 2017
(www.socio.org.uk/fgct)
Technically co-sponsored by IEEE UK &amp; RI
(IEEE Explore proceedings)

Co-located Workshop
First International Workshop on &quot;IoT and Antenna Design&quot; (IoTAD)

In the last decade, a number of newer communication technologies have 
been evolved, which have a significant impact on the technology, as a 
whole. The impact ranges from incremental applications to dramatical 
breakthrough in the society. Users rely heavily on broadcast technology, 
social media, mobile devices, video games and other innovations to 
enrich the learning and adoption process.

This conference is designed for teachers, administrators, practitioners, 
researchers and scientists in the development arenas. It aims to provide 
discussions and simulations in the communication technology at the broad 
level and broadcasting technology and related technologies at the micro 
level. Through a set of research papers, using innovative and 
interactive approach, participants can expect to share a set of research 
that will prepare them to apply new technologies to their work in 
teaching, research and educational development amid this rapidly 
evolving landscape.

Topics discussed in this platform are not limited to-

  Emerging cellular and new network architectures for 5G
  New antenna and RF technology for 5G wireless
  Modulation algorithms
  Circuits, software and systems for 5G
  Convergence of multi-modes, multi-bands, multi-standards and multi- 
applications in 5G systems
  Cognitive radio and collaborative transmissions in 5G
  Computing and processing platform for 5G
  Programming models and development tools to enable 5G systems
  Small cells and heterogeneous networks
  Metrics and Evaluation of 5G systems
  Standardization of 5G
  Deployment options such as small cells, eICIC, MIMO and CoMP
  LTE/WiFi interworking, carrier aggregation, dual connectivity
