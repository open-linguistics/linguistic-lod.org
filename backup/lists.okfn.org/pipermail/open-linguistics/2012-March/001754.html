<PRE>Hi everyone,

I for one thoroughly enjoyed the workshop and want to thank Christian and the two Sebastians for their very successful organization!

I would like to suggest that as a further effort towards making the OWLG more visible, we consider submitting a short note (8 pages) that is along the lines of the conference paper to to the journal I co-edit with Nicoletta Calzolari, Language Resources and Evaluation. If the paper is the LREC one, then publishing a version in LRE (which is a sort of companion to LREC) would be very appropriate.

Again, many thanks to the organizers for a very worthwhile and enjoyable workshop!

Best,
Nancy

&gt;<i> Dear all,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I hope you enjoyed the workshop as much as I did. As far as I am concerned, I had a great time, and I was really surprised by the number of people and by the continuing interest in linked data in linguistics. For me, it was fascinating, but I also feel quite exhausted :) Anyway, thanks to everyone who managed to join us.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The minutes of the final discussion can be found under <A HREF="http://linguistics.okfnpad.org/ldl2012,">http://linguistics.okfnpad.org/ldl2012,</A> and we will need a few days to reflect about everything and to sort things out, at least I do. But there is one relatively urgent item, and this is concerned with creating a joint publication. At the moment, we have some joint publications in the pipeline, including a conference paper that should serve as a general introduction and overview over the OWLG, on-going activities and pet projects of some its members. For the time being, this paper would represent the first joint publication of the OWLG, and until the next &quot;status paper&quot; will appear, this would serve as a reference.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For those who saw / contributed to the poster: The idea is to have a full paper version with basically the same content, i.e., a general description of goals and activities (which we already have) and a number of brief presentations of individual data sets and/or activities that fit into the general OWLG conception (which may be easily extended).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, the deadline for this is already *next Wednesday*. We were quite occupied with preparing the workshop the last few weeks, so that this is a bit late by now ..., but it would be great if more people could contribute.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you would like to be involved in this publication or later ones, and if you've not been involved in the conference paper (those who contributed to the poster and/or were present at the last telcos already are), please send an email to the list. Details of the publication will be discussed on a personal basis among those who volunteered.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> All the best,
</I>&gt;<i> Christian
