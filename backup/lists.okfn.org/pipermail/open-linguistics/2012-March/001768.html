<PRE>Dear all,

we just finalized the LREC paper, thanks to everyone who helped. Aside  
 from a general description of the LDL, the paper focuses on the  
description of our on-going efforts to create a LLOD cloud.

The current version can be found under  
<A HREF="http://wiki.okfn.org/Wg/linguistics/publications#Joint_Publications_of_OWLG_members">http://wiki.okfn.org/Wg/linguistics/publications#Joint_Publications_of_OWLG_members</A>  
(LREC 2012). In case anyone finds a typo, we still have something like 90  
minutes to fix it ;)

Right now, we have two more joint publications &quot;in the pipeline&quot;, a book  
chapter focusing on interoperability issues due mid-April, and the LREC  
post-publication that was suggested by Nancy (thank you again for bringing  
this up !). Anyone interested in contributing and who is was not CC-ed in  
the LREC-related communication, please write me (or the list) an email to  
be included.

For forthcoming publications, it would probably be good to set up a  
separate, closed mailing list specifically for discussing publication  
details rather than addressing individual recipients. Unfortunately, I  
won't have the time to organize this in the next few weeks, but it would  
be great if someone would volunteer to take care of this.

All the best, and thanks again,
Christian

&gt;<i> Dear all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hope you enjoyed the workshop as much as I did. As far as I am  
</I>&gt;<i> concerned, I had a great time, and I was really surprised by the number  
</I>&gt;<i> of people and by the continuing interest in linked data in linguistics.  
</I>&gt;<i> For me, it was fascinating, but I also feel quite exhausted :) Anyway,  
</I>&gt;<i> thanks to everyone who managed to join us.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The minutes of the final discussion can be found under  
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://linguistics.okfnpad.org/ldl2012,">http://linguistics.okfnpad.org/ldl2012,</A> and we will need a few days to  
</I>&gt;<i> reflect about everything and to sort things out, at least I do. But  
</I>&gt;<i> there is one relatively urgent item, and this is concerned with creating  
</I>&gt;<i> a joint publication. At the moment, we have some joint publications in  
</I>&gt;<i> the pipeline, including a conference paper that should serve as a  
</I>&gt;<i> general introduction and overview over the OWLG, on-going activities and  
</I>&gt;<i> pet projects of some its members. For the time being, this paper would  
</I>&gt;<i> represent the first joint publication of the OWLG, and until the next  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;status paper&quot; will appear, this would serve as a reference.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For those who saw / contributed to the poster: The idea is to have a  
</I>&gt;<i> full paper version with basically the same content, i.e., a general  
</I>&gt;<i> description of goals and activities (which we already have) and a number  
</I>&gt;<i> of brief presentations of individual data sets and/or activities that  
</I>&gt;<i> fit into the general OWLG conception (which may be easily extended).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, the deadline for this is already *next Wednesday*. We  
</I>&gt;<i> were quite occupied with preparing the workshop the last few weeks, so  
</I>&gt;<i> that this is a bit late by now ..., but it would be great if more people  
</I>&gt;<i> could contribute.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you would like to be involved in this publication or later ones, and  
</I>&gt;<i> if you've not been involved in the conference paper (those who  
</I>&gt;<i> contributed to the poster and/or were present at the last telcos already  
</I>&gt;<i> are), please send an email to the list. Details of the publication will  
</I>&gt;<i> be discussed on a personal basis among those who volunteered.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All the best,
</I>&gt;<i> Christian
