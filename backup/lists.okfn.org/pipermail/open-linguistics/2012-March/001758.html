<PRE>Wow!
     Thanks a lot for the very useful information and links you have 
sent in your e-mail. I love the protocol/policies you have developed ;-)
     Let's do things the other way around. I prefer being honest and add 
the bubbles only when OntoLingAnnot meets ALL the requirements, which 
might be by September/October. There is no need to hurry on my part. If 
OntoLingAnnot's bubbles are added to the &quot;As of January/February, 2013&quot; 
version, that would be just as great.
     The thing is that a first version is already stored in my hard disk 
(and backed-up in several USB memories and external hard disks, just in 
case ;-)), but I like checking twice and up to ten times the job done, 
if necessary. So, from June/July onwards, I (1) will check it all again, 
(2) add some properties that I have in mind to add in order to extend 
the model, (3) publish it all on my research group's webpage, and (4) 
upload them to SVN or alike and let people interact with them (as 
Sebastian suggested in the workshop). Then, I will follow the remaining 
steps in the protocol so that OntoLingAnnot's datasets can be added to 
the current datasets in the diagram.
     As for the &quot;external&quot; links, the ones with OLiA were created for 
OntoTag. The taxonomy of morphosyntactic units has not changed much, but 
I am not sure that the taxonomies for morphosyntactic 
attributes/features and values are the same in OntoLingAnnot. In fact, I 
think they have changed a lot. We can check that and create the new 
links between OLiA and OntoLingAnnot at some point in the near future - 
that might be a nice collaborative research ;-). And you know that, 
being part an official member of ISO/TC 37, **I have to** link the 
OntoLingAnnot dataset with the ISOcat data categories, but I am not sure 
that I should do this before the **real** standardisation process has 
started :-(. I hope that the ISO/TC 37 meeting in Madrid can help boot 
this task up.
     This is my opinion as of today, when all I can think of is the 
courses I have to teach next week :-(. However, if you have a different 
opinion, just let me know.
     Best,
                 Antonio.

&gt;<i> Dear Antonio,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> yes, we can add a &quot;new bubble&quot; in the diagram at any time, and even 
</I>&gt;<i> before next Wednesday ;) We have to specify the exact conditions for 
</I>&gt;<i> the process somewhere with greater level of detail. (And maybe, 
</I>&gt;<i> discuss it on the mailing list.) So far, the conditions we applied are 
</I>&gt;<i> the same as for the LOD cloud diagram 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://richard.cyganiak.de/2007/10/lod/#how-to-join,">http://richard.cyganiak.de/2007/10/lod/#how-to-join,</A> with the 
</I>&gt;<i> following differences:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - As long as we consider this to be a draft, it is sufficient to 
</I>&gt;<i> provide a committment that the data *will* be provided in this form at 
</I>&gt;<i> some (unspecified) point in time. As soon as we drop the &quot;draft&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> attribute, all data needs to be actually available, or the bubble will 
</I>&gt;<i> be removed. We can discuss about the time when this should happen, but 
</I>&gt;<i> certainly not earlier than next year.
</I>&gt;<i> - The same is true for links: If someone declares himself responsible 
</I>&gt;<i> for creating the links (at some point in time), a link will be drawn.
</I>&gt;<i> - We have not yet applied any restrictions on the size and the number 
</I>&gt;<i> of links per data set. This might be necessary with increasing growth 
</I>&gt;<i> of the diagram.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Further, on the wiki we describe a process for adding a new bubble: 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://wiki.okfn.org/Wg/linguistics/llod#How_to_contribute.">http://wiki.okfn.org/Wg/linguistics/llod#How_to_contribute.</A> It would 
</I>&gt;<i> be good practice to introduce the new data set and its (prospective) 
</I>&gt;<i> availability with a message to th mailing list, also, a website should 
</I>&gt;<i> be provided, or a page in our wiki should be c&#180;reated. The bubble then 
</I>&gt;<i> contains a hyperlink to this page.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For every new data set, we have to clarify which links with other 
</I>&gt;<i> resources can be established. For your data, this is probably already 
</I>&gt;<i> the case, because I have a linking between the OLiA reference model 
</I>&gt;<i> and your morphosyntactic ontologies. (I guess it hasn't changed too 
</I>&gt;<i> much since then, has it ?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best,
</I>&gt;<i> Christian

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Dear Christian,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      I have had a look at the poster. It looks great. However, I 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would love to see a bubble for the &quot;OntoLingAnnot Model&quot; added to the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ones for &quot;annotated corpora, schemes for annotated corpora&quot;, and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> another one for &quot;OntoLingAnnot's ontologies&quot; to the ones for 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;metadata and terminology repositories, linguistic KBs&quot;. If a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reference is needed, you could use the one associated to the LDL 2012 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> workshop ;-).
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      Thanks again for a wonderful workshop and for letting me join 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this wonderful initiative.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      Time for me to go to the airport now and fly back to Madrid.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      Best,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                      Antonio.
