<PRE>This caught me also in a very busy time, but I can try to help, depending
on what's needed.

Best,
Pablo

&gt;<i> Dear all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hope you enjoyed the workshop as much as I did. As far as I am
</I>&gt;<i> concerned, I had a great time, and I was really surprised by the number of
</I>&gt;<i> people and by the continuing interest in linked data in linguistics. For
</I>&gt;<i> me, it was fascinating, but I also feel quite exhausted :) Anyway, thanks
</I>&gt;<i> to everyone who managed to join us.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The minutes of the final discussion can be found under
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://linguistics.okfnpad.**org/ldl2012&lt;http://linguistics.okfnpad.org/ldl2012">http://linguistics.okfnpad.**org/ldl2012&lt;http://linguistics.okfnpad.org/ldl2012</A>&gt;,
</I>&gt;<i> and we will need a few days to reflect about everything and to sort things
</I>&gt;<i> out, at least I do. But there is one relatively urgent item, and this is
</I>&gt;<i> concerned with creating a joint publication. At the moment, we have some
</I>&gt;<i> joint publications in the pipeline, including a conference paper that
</I>&gt;<i> should serve as a general introduction and overview over the OWLG, on-going
</I>&gt;<i> activities and pet projects of some its members. For the time being, this
</I>&gt;<i> paper would represent the first joint publication of the OWLG, and until
</I>&gt;<i> the next &quot;status paper&quot; will appear, this would serve as a reference.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For those who saw / contributed to the poster: The idea is to have a full
</I>&gt;<i> paper version with basically the same content, i.e., a general description
</I>&gt;<i> of goals and activities (which we already have) and a number of brief
</I>&gt;<i> presentations of individual data sets and/or activities that fit into the
</I>&gt;<i> general OWLG conception (which may be easily extended).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, the deadline for this is already *next Wednesday*. We were
</I>&gt;<i> quite occupied with preparing the workshop the last few weeks, so that this
</I>&gt;<i> is a bit late by now ..., but it would be great if more people could
</I>&gt;<i> contribute.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you would like to be involved in this publication or later ones, and if
</I>&gt;<i> you've not been involved in the conference paper (those who contributed to
</I>&gt;<i> the poster and/or were present at the last telcos already are), please send
</I>&gt;<i> an email to the list. Details of the publication will be discussed on a
</I>&gt;<i> personal basis among those who volunteered.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All the best,
</I>&gt;<i> Christian
