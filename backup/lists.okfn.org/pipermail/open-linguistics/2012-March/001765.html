<PRE>3rd Workshop of the People's Web meets NLP:
Collaboratively Constructed Semantic Resources and their Applications to NLP

Jeju, Republic of Korea
July 13, 2012
<A HREF="http://www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/scientific-community/acl-2012-workshop">http://www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/scientific-community/acl-2012-workshop</A>

In accordance with the extended camera-ready deadline for the ACL workshops, the 3rd workshop of &quot;The Peoples' Web meets NLP&quot; now has a new schedule adjusted as follows.

April  8, 2012  Paper submission deadline (full and short)
May  9, 2012  Notification of acceptance
May 18, 2012  Camera-ready due
July 13, 2012  Workshop

Recent recognition of Collaboratively Constructed Semantic Resources (CSRs) has substantially contributed to the research in natural language processing (NLP). The 3rd workshop &quot;The People's Web meets NLP&quot; invites both long and short papers on various CSRs-related topics. Preference will be given to submissions on CSRs' application to NLP tasks, which is the special interest of this workshop edition. We also welcome tutorial-like submissions on using the software for CSRs to facilitate their wide adoption by the NLP community.

The new submission deadline for full and short papers is *April 8, 2012*.
For details, please refer to the workshop website.
