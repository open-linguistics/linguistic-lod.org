FINAL CALL FOR PAPERS

3rd Workshop of the People's Web meets NLP:
Collaboratively Constructed Semantic Resources and their Applications to NLP

Jeju, Republic of Korea
July 13, 2012
<A HREF="http://www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/scientific-community/acl-2012-workshop">http://www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/scientific-community/acl-2012-workshop</A>


===Schedule===

March 18, 2012          Paper submission deadline (full and short)
April 16, 2012          Notification of acceptance
April 30, 2012          Camera-ready version due
July 13, 2012          ACL 2012 Workshops


===Introduction===

Recent recognition of Collaboratively Constructed Semantic Resources (CSRs) has
substantially contributed to the research in natural language processing (NLP).
The 3rd workshop &quot;The People's Web meets NLP&quot; invites both long and short papers
on various CSRs-related topics. Preference will be given to submissions on CSRs'
application to NLP tasks, which is the special interest of this workshop
edition. We also welcome tutorial-like submissions on using the software for
CSRs to facilitate their wide adoption by the NLP community.

Specific topics include but are not limited to:
* Using collaboratively constructed resources and the information mined from 
  them for NLP tasks (cf. Section &quot;References&quot;), such as word sense 
  disambiguation, semantic role labeling, information retrieval, text 
  categorization, information extraction, question answering, etc.; 
* Mining social and collaborative content for constructing structured lexical 
  semantic resources, annotated corpora and the corresponding tools; 
* Analyzing the structure of collaboratively constructed resources related to 
  their use in NLP; 
* Computational linguistics studies of collaboratively constructed resources, 
  such as wiki-based platforms or folksonomies; 
* Structural and semantic interoperability of collaboratively constructed 
  resources with conventional semantic resources and between themselves; 
* Mining multilingual information from collaboratively constructed resources;
* Using special features of collaboratively constructed resources to create 
  novel resource types, for example revision-based corpora, simplified versions
  of resources, etc.; 
* Quality and reliability of collaboratively constructed lexical semantic 
  resources and annotated corpora; 
* Hands-on practical knowledge on utilization of CSR APIs and tools or designing 
  crowdsourcing procedures for high quality outcomes.
