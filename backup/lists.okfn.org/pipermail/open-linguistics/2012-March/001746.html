<PRE>Dear all,

I hope you enjoyed the workshop as much as I did. As far as I am  
concerned, I had a great time, and I was really surprised by the number of  
people and by the continuing interest in linked data in linguistics. For  
me, it was fascinating, but I also feel quite exhausted :) Anyway, thanks  
to everyone who managed to join us.

The minutes of the final discussion can be found under  
<A HREF="http://linguistics.okfnpad.org/ldl2012,">http://linguistics.okfnpad.org/ldl2012,</A> and we will need a few days to  
reflect about everything and to sort things out, at least I do. But there  
is one relatively urgent item, and this is concerned with creating a joint  
publication. At the moment, we have some joint publications in the  
pipeline, including a conference paper that should serve as a general  
introduction and overview over the OWLG, on-going activities and pet  
projects of some its members. For the time being, this paper would  
represent the first joint publication of the OWLG, and until the next  
&quot;status paper&quot; will appear, this would serve as a reference.

For those who saw / contributed to the poster: The idea is to have a full  
paper version with basically the same content, i.e., a general description  
of goals and activities (which we already have) and a number of brief  
presentations of individual data sets and/or activities that fit into the  
general OWLG conception (which may be easily extended).

Unfortunately, the deadline for this is already *next Wednesday*. We were  
quite occupied with preparing the workshop the last few weeks, so that  
this is a bit late by now ..., but it would be great if more people could  
contribute.

If you would like to be involved in this publication or later ones, and if  
you've not been involved in the conference paper (those who contributed to  
the poster and/or were present at the last telcos already are), please  
send an email to the list. Details of the publication will be discussed on  
a personal basis among those who volunteered.

All the best,
Christian


</PRE>
