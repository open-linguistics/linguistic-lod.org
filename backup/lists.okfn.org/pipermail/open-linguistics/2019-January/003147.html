<PRE>Joint Workshop on Multiword Expressions and Wordnets (MWE-WN 2019)

<A HREF="http://multiword.sourceforge.net/mwewn2019/">http://multiword.sourceforge.net/mwewn2019/</A>

Workshop at ACL 2019 &lt;<A HREF="http://www.acl2019.org/EN/index.xhtml">http://www.acl2019.org/EN/index.xhtml</A>&gt; (Florence,
Italy), August 2, 2019

Organized and sponsored by the Special Interest Group on the Lexicon (SIGLEX
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.siglex.org/">http://www.siglex.org/</A>&gt;) of the Association for Computational Linguistics (
ACL &lt;<A HREF="https://www.aclweb.org/portal/">https://www.aclweb.org/portal/</A>&gt;). Endorsed by the Global Wordnet
Association &lt;<A HREF="http://globalwordnet.org/">http://globalwordnet.org/</A>&gt;.  This event is the 15th edition of
the Workshop on Multiword Expressions (MWE
&lt;<A HREF="http://multiword.sourceforge.net/PHITE.php?sitesig=CONF">http://multiword.sourceforge.net/PHITE.php?sitesig=CONF</A>&gt;).

Description

As a joint event, this workshop  addresses two domains &#8211; multiword
expressions and Wordnets &#8211; with partly overlapping communities and research
interests, but relatively divergent practices and terminologies.

Multiword expressions (MWEs) are word combinations, such as all of a sudden,
a hot dog, to pay a visit or to pull one's leg, which exhibit lexical,
syntactic, semantic, pragmatic and/or statistical idiosyncrasies. MWEs
encompass
closely related linguistic objects such as idioms, compounds, light verb
constructions, rhetorical figures, institutionalised phrases or
collocations. Modelling and computational aspects of MWEs have been covered
by the Multiword Expression Workshop, organised over the past years by the MWE
section &lt;<A HREF="http://multiword.sourceforge.net/">http://multiword.sourceforge.net/</A>&gt; of SIGLEX
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.siglex.org/">http://www.siglex.org/</A>&gt;. Because of their unpredictable behavior, and most
prominently their non-compositional semantics, MWEs pose special problems
in linguistic modelling (e.g. treebank annotation and grammar engineering),
in NLP pipelines (e.g. when their orchestration with parsing is concerned),
and in end-use applications (e.g. information extraction or machine
translation).

&gt;<i>From its very beginning, Princeton WordNet has included MWEs, and linked
</I>their meanings into a shared network: talk, blab, sing, spill the beans,
let the cat out of the bag, tattle, peach, babble, babble out, blab out
&#8220;divulge confidential information or secrets&#8221;. Indeed, over 50% of entries
in the Princeton WordNet of English are MWEs and most other wordnets have a
similarly high percentage. However, MWEs are generally encoded as a string,
with no internal information about syntactic structure or
compositionality.  Many suggestions for richer encodings have been made but
not yet widely adopted, partly because of the cost of adding richer data to
already large lexicons.

For the above reasons, the MWE and WN communities are organizing this joint
event, which should allow better convergences and scientific innovation. We
call for papers focusing on research related (but not limited) to the
following topics.
Joint topics on MWEs and Wordnets

   -

   Encoding MWEs in wordnets --- how can we take advantage of the existing
   rich structure of wordnets?
   -

   Encoding MWEs in wordnets --- consequences for a lexical-semantic
   organization of MWEs
   -

   Linking wordnets with existing MWE lexicons
   -

   Word sense disambiguation for single-word and multiword expressions
   -

   Cross-wordnet and cross-language comparisons of MWEs
   -

   MWEs in sense-annotated corpora
   -

   Semantic relations in wordnets related to MWEs

MWE-specific topics

   -

   Computationally-applicable theoretical studies on MWEs and constructions
   in psycholinguistics, corpus linguistics and formal grammars
   -

   MWE and construction annotation in corpora and treebanks
   -

   MWE and construction representation in manually/automatically
   constructed lexical resources
   -

   Processing of MWEs and constructions in syntactic and semantic
   frameworks (e.g. CCG, CxG, HPSG, LFG, TAG, UD, etc.), and in end-user
   applications (e.g. information extraction, machine translation and
   summarization)
   -

   Original discovery and identification methods for MWEs and constructions
   -

   MWEs and constructions in language acquisition and in non-standard
   language (e.g. tweets, forums, spontaneous speech)
   -

   Evaluation of annotation and processing techniques for MWEs and
   constructions
   -

   Retrospective comparative analyses from the PARSEME shared tasks on
   automatic identification of MWEs

Note that, with the intention to also perpetuate previous converging
effects with the Construction Grammar community (see the LAW-MWE-CxG 2018
workshop &lt;<A HREF="http://multiword.sourceforge.net/lawmwecxg2018/">http://multiword.sourceforge.net/lawmwecxg2018/</A>&gt;), we extend the
traditional MWE scope to include grammatical constructions.

Submission modalities

There are two tracks:

   -

   Regular research track, where the submissions must be substantially
   original.
   -

   Dissemination track, which welcomes recent previously published work (or
   work accepted for publication), dedicated explicitly both to MWEs and
   WordNet.   This will be presented to encourage discussion, but only the
   abstract will appear in the proceedings.

The regular research track submissions should follow one of the 2 formats:

   -

   Long papers (8 content pages + references): Long papers should report on
   solid and finished research including new experimental results, resources
   and/or techniques.
   -

   Short papers (4 content pages + references): Short papers should report
   on small experiments, focused contributions, ongoing research, negative
   results and/or philosophical discussion.

The decisions as to oral or poster presentations of the selected papers
will be taken by the PC chairs. No distinction between papers presented
orally and as posters is made in the workshop proceedings. There is no
limit on the number of reference pages. Authors will be granted an extra
page for the final version of their papers. The submission will be
double-blind, as understood by the ACL 2019 submission policy. The reported
research should be substantially original. Papers available as preprints
can also be submitted provided that they fulfil the conditions defined by
the new ACL Policies for Submission, Review and Citation
&lt;<A HREF="https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/new-policies-submission-review-and-citation">https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/new-policies-submission-review-and-citation</A>&gt;.
For both types of submissions in this track, the ACL 2019 templates should
be used.

The dissemination track submissions are not anonymous, and they should not
exceed one page, including the authors' names and affiliations, the mention
of the original venue, the link to the original paper and a short
explanation why the paper is relevant to MWEs and Wordnets workshop. If the
original paper is not publicly available, it should also be submitted in a
separate .pdf file but it does not have to follow the ACL 2019 template.

All papers should be submitted via the START space which will be announced
in the future calls.

Please choose the appropriate track (research/dissemination) and for
research papers the submission modality (long/short).
