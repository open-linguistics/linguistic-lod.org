DSI incorporates the NUI Galway node of the nationwide Insight Centre for
Data Analytics. DSI hosts more than 100 staff and has established itself as
a top player worldwide in the areas of Semantic Web and Linked Data. It has
successfully implemented a research strategy around the goal of &#8220;Enabling
Networked Knowledge&#8221;, which aims at capitalizing on knowledge as the fuel
for the digital service economy, by linking information and exploiting the
resulting knowledge graphs as the basis for economic productivity. The
institute performs fundamental and applied research in a range of research
areas to enable this, including data streams and sensor networks, knowledge
discovery, natural language processing, social semantics and social network
analysis, among others. Research outcomes are applied in use cases across a
range of domains, including eGovernment, financial services, manufacturing,
eHealth and Life Sciences.

Job Description:

The Data Science Institute (DSI) at NUI Galway is inviting applications for

the field, as well as being able to envision opportunities and work
collaboratively is key.

The researcher will be involved in leading the creation of a tool to
support the acquisition and enrichment of lexicographic data from text,
including the identification of headwords, word senses, definitions,
