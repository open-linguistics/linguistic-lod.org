==============

We invite submissions to the second biennial conference on Language, 
Data and Knowledge (LDK 2019), which will be held in Leipzig, Germany in 
May 2019. This conference aims at bringing together researchers from 
across disciplines concerned with the acquisition, curation and use of 
language data in the context of data science and knowledge-based 
applications. This builds upon the success of the inaugural event held 
in Galway, Ireland in 2017.

------------------
Invited speakers

We are glad to announce two already confirmed invited speakers:
- Christian Bizer, Universit&#228;t Mannheim, Germany
- Christiane Fellbaum, Princeton University, USA

------------------
Co-allocated events
Website: <A HREF="http://2019.ldk-conf.org/program/workshops/">http://2019.ldk-conf.org/program/workshops/</A>

- Workshops:
- Translation Inference across Dictionaries (TIAD)
- 3rd Workshop on Humanities in the Semantic web (WHiSe III)
- 13th DBpedia Community Meeting

------------------
Main Conference paper submission

We welcome submission of relevance to the topics listed below. 
Submissions can be in the form of:
Long research papers: 10-15 pages;
Short research or position papers: 6-8 pages;
Short scientific abstract submissions: be 4-6 pages.

All submissions lengths are given including references and optional 
appendices.

Accepted submissions will be published by OASIcs in an open-access 
conference proceedings volume. The layout templates are available for 
download from the OASIcs website at: 
<A HREF="https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/oasics/instructions-for-authors/">https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/oasics/instructions-for-authors/</A>

Submission is double-blind and hence all submissions should be suitably 
anonymized by omitting author names in the header and citing previous 
own work in the third person (not &#8220;as we showed in ...&#8221; but &#8220;as Smith 
(2017) showed ...&#8221;).

Papers should be submitted via EasyChair at the following address:
<A HREF="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ldk2019">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ldk2019</A>

------------------
Presentation format

Accepted submissions will be selected for oral or poster presentation 
based on recommendations from the reviewers (with no difference in 
quality between types of presentation).
Authors of accepted short papers and scientific abstract are welcome to 
present their work as a demo in addition to the regular presentation.
At least one author of each accepted paper must register to present the 
paper at the conference.
