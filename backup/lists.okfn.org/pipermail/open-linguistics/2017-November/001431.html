Call for Papers: Special Issue of the Semantic Web Journal on 
Semantic Deep Learning 


Semantic Web technologies and deep learning share the goal of creating intelligent artifacts that emulate human capacities such as reasoning, validating, and predicting. Both fields have been impacting data and knowledge analysis considerably as well as their associated abstract representations. Deep learning is a term used to refer to deep neural network algorithms that learn data representations by means of transformations with multiple processing layers. These architectures have frequently been applied in NLP to feature learning from raw data, such as part-of-speech-tagging, morphological tagging, language modeling, and so forth. Semantic Web technologies and knowledge representation, on the other hand, boost the re-use and sharing of knowledge in a structured and machine readable fashion. Semantic resources such as WikiData, Yago, BabelNet or DBpedia, as well as knowledge base construction and completion methods have been successfully applied to improved systems addressing semantically intensive tasks (e.g. Question Answering). 
There are notable examples of contributions leveraging either deep neural architectures or distributed representations learned via deep neural networks in the broad area of Semantic Web technologies. These include, among others: (lightweight) ontology learning, ontology alignment, ontology annotation, joined relational and multi-modal knowledge representations, and ontology prediction. Ontologies, on the other hand, have been repeatedly utilized as background knowledge for machine learning tasks. As an example, there is a myriad of hybrid approaches for learning embeddings by jointly incorporating corpus-based evidence and semantic resources. This interplay between structured knowledge and corpus-based approaches has given way to knowledge-rich embeddings, which in turn have proven useful for tasks such as hypernym discovery, collocation discovery and classification, word sense disambiguation, joined relational and multi-modal knowledge representations and many others. 
In this special issue, we invite submissions that illustrate how Semantic Web resources and technologies can benefit from an interaction with deep learning. At the same time, we are interested in submissions that show how knowledge representation can assist in deep learning tasks deployed in the field of NLP and how knowledge representation systems can build on top of deep learning results. 
Topics include, but are not limited to: 

    * 
Structured knowledge in deep learning 


        * 
learning and applying knowledge graph embeddings 
        * 
applications of knowledge-rich embeddings 
        * 
neural networks and logic rules 
        * 
learning semantic similarity and encoding distances as knowledge graph 
        * 
ontology-based text classification 
        * 
multilingual resources for neural representations of linguistics 
        * 
semantic role labeling 
    * 

Deep reasoning and inferences 


        * 
commonsense reasoning and vector space models 
        * 
reasoning with deep learning methods 
    * 

Learning knowledge representations with deep learning 


        * 
word embeddings for ontology matching and alignment 
        * 
deep learning and semantic web technologies for specialized domains 
        * 
deep learning ontologies 
        * 
deep learning models for learning knowledge representations from text 
        * 
deep learning ontological annotations 
    * 

Joint tasks 


        * 
mining multilingual natural language for SPARQL queries 
        * 
information retrieval and extraction with knowledge graphs and deep learning models 
        * 
knowledge-based deep word sense disambiguation and entity linking 
        * 
investigation of compatibilities and incompatibilities between deep learning and Semantic Web approaches 
        * 
neural networks for learning Linked Data 

Deadline 


    * Submission deadline: 28 February 2017. Papers submitted before the deadline will be reviewed upon receipt. 


Submission Instructions
