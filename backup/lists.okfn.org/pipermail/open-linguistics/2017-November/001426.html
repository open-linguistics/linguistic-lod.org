<PRE>Dear all,

please find below the Call for Papers for our next workshop on Linked Data  
in Linguistics.
Apologies for cross-posting.

Best regards,
Christian (for the organizers)

We cordially invite submissions to the 6th Workshop on Linked Data in  
Linguistics (LDL-2018): Towards Linguistic Data Science, held in  
conjunction with the 11th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference  
(LREC-2018), Saturday, 12 May 2018, Miyazaki, Japan,  
<A HREF="http://ldl2018.linguistic-lod.org/">http://ldl2018.linguistic-lod.org/</A>

The  Linked Data in Linguistics (LDL) workshop series has become the major  
forum for presenting, discussing and the application of *Semantic Web  
standards and the Linked Open Data paradigm to language resources* and  
will take place again in 2018 in co-location with the 11th Language  
Resources and Evaluation Conference in Miyazaki, Japan. The LDL workshop  
series has a general focus on LOD-based language resources, vocabularies,  
infrastructures and technologies as means for *managing, improving and  
using language resources on the Web*,  addressing communities as diverse  
as applied linguistics, lexicography, digital humanities, natural language  
processing and information technology. LDL provides the primary forum for  
these communities *to present and to discuss use cases, experiences, best  
practices, recommendations and technologies* of Linguistic Linked Open  
Data  in an interdisciplinary setting, addressing topics such as

(i) *linking language resources*: Linked Data facilitates to the  
interoperability, re-usability and discoverability of language resources  
as well as information integration across them.
(ii) *natural language for structured knowledge*: Ontologies and knowledge  
bases in general are often created with one particular language in mind.  
Their lexicalization for other natural languages is a prime directive for  
emerging digital infrastructures in a globalized world.
(iii) *structured knowledge for natural language*: Natural language is in  
constant development, thus inherently imprecise. Grounding natural  
language text in structured  knowledge (word sense disambiguation, entity  
linking, semantic parsing) enables machine readability and processability  
by downstream tasks.

Moreover, as technology and resources increasingly converge towards a  
LOD-based ecosystem for the systematic cross-lingual discovery,  
exploitation, extension, and curation of language resources, we  
particularly encourage contributions focusing on the development of  
*research methodologies and applications* building on the Linguistic  
Linked Open Data Cloud and the existing technology and resource stack: The  
notion of *Linguistic Data Science* brings together Linguistic Linked Open  
Data with research questions in linguistics, methods in Natural Language  
Processing and applications in Digital Humanities. The workshop will also  
provide the opportunity for the *critical reflection* of Linked Open Data  
techniques and their application in linguistics, natural language  
processing and related fields, i.e., to express experiences, challenges,  
crucial issues, missing aspects regarding the reuse, creation and  
exploitation of Linguistic Linked Open Data.

Topics of Interest
------------------
We invite presentations of algorithms, methodologies, experiments, use  
cases, descriptions of research projects and position papers regarding the  
creation, publication or application of language resources and their  
linking, as well as descriptions of such data and its uses in research  
(linguistics, lexicology, Digital Humanities) and technology (natural  
language processing, lexicography, localization). This includes the  
following aspects:

(1) Building and managing linked language resources
   - Vocabularies and best practices for language resources and their  
linking.
   - Application of LOD in language resource infrastructures.
   - Metadata linking and curation for language resources on the Web.

(2) LLOD technology and methodology
   - Methodologies to develop linked language resources on the Web.
   - Using natural language processing to enhance Linked Open Data.
   - Leveraging Linguistic Linked Open Data and Machine Learning.
   - Methods for linking dictionaries across languages.

(3)	LLOD applications
   - Using Linked Open Data to facilitate natural language processing.
   - Using Linked Open Data for quantitative and qualitative linguistic  
research.
   - Linguistic Linked Open Data for Digital Humanities.
   - Linking language resources and external community resources.
   - Using Linked Open Data to connect lexicographic resources.

(4)	Critical Reflection
   - Challenges of scalability, multilinguality and interoperability in the  
Web.
   - Legal, social and scientific aspects of Linguistic Linked Open Data.
   - LLOD revisited: Case studies, use cases, and lessons learnt.

We invite both long (8 pages and 2 pages of references, formatted  
according to the LREC guidelines) and short papers (4 pages and 2 pages of  
references) representing original research, innovative approaches and  
resource descriptions. Short papers may also represent project  
descriptions. These do not have to be implemented but discuss to what  
extent and for which purposes Linguistic Linked Open Data is reused or  
created. Projects that are still in their early stages and seek advice  
 from the broader Linguistic Linked Data community are welcome, especially  
if they include underrepresented fields of study.

Identify, Describe and Share your LRs !
---------------------------------------
Describing your LRs in the LRE Map is now a normal practice in the  
submission procedure of LREC. To continue the efforts initiated at LREC  
2014 about &#8220;Sharing LRs&#8221; (data, tools, web-services, etc.), authors will  
have the possibility, when submitting a paper, to upload LRs in a special  
LREC repository. This effort of sharing LRs, linked to the LRE Map for  
their description, may become a new regular feature for conferences in our  
field, thus contributing to creating a common repository where everyone  
can deposit and share data.

As scientific work requires accurate citations of referenced work so as to  
allow the community to understand the whole context and also replicate the  
experiments conducted by other researchers, LREC 2018 endorses the need to  
uniquely Identify LRs through the use of the International Standard  
Language Resource Number (ISLRN, www.islrn.org), a Persistent Unique  
Identifier to be assigned to each Language Resource. The assignment of  
ISLRNs to LRs cited in LREC papers will be offered at submission time.
