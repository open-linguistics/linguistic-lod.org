ESWC 2016 Call For Poster Papers
May 29th - June 2nd, 2016
Anissaras, Crete, Greece
<A HREF="http://2016.eswc-conferences.org/call-posters">http://2016.eswc-conferences.org/call-posters</A>
=====================================================================


The Poster Track of ESWC 2016 will provide an opportunity for presenting 
late-breaking results, on-going research projects, and speculative or 
innovative work in progress. Posters are intended to provide authors and 
participants with the ability to connect with each other and to engage 
in discussions about the work.

We invite submissions relevant to the area of the semantics in various 
sectors, including:  Urban Life and Mobility, eHealth, eGovernment, 
eEnvironment, Life Sciences, Sensor networks and RDF Stream Processing, 
Linked Science, Media and entertainment, Telecommunications, Cultural 
heritage, Financial services, Energy and utilities, Manufacturing, 
Digital libraries, Cloud applications, Personal Information Management, 
Decision support, Emergency and crisis management covering also 
inter-sectorial aspects of Cognitive Computing, Data Semantics, and 
Natural Language Processing.

Papers submitted to the research track will NOT automatically be 
considered for the poster track. A separate poster submission must be 
made. For example, a poster can be used to present work that was 
insufficiently mature for the research track.

Prize and minute madness
Accepted posters will be included into the &#8220;minute madness&#8221; pitch 
introducing the poster and demo session during the conference. They will 
also be enrolled into the competition for the best poster of ESWC 2016. 
More information about the &#8220;minute madness&#8221; material and program will be 
provided to the authors of accepted submissions.

Submission Guidelines
Authors must submit a 4-page paper (Springer LNCS style, 
<A HREF="https://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0">https://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0</A>) with a 
short abstract for evaluation. The paper must clearly demonstrate 
relevance to the Semantic Web and the topics of interest of ESWC 2016. 
Decisions about acceptance will be based on relevance to the Semantic 
Web, originality, potential significance, topicality and clarity. Papers 
that exceed the given page length or do not follow the LNCS guidelines 
will be rejected without a review. Submissions must be uploaded on 
Easychair selecting the ESWC 2016 Posters Track at 
<A HREF="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eswc2016pd">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eswc2016pd</A> .

Important Dates
Submission Deadline: March 6, 2016
Notification of Acceptance: April 4, 2016
Camera-Ready Paper: April 18, 2016

All deadlines are intended to be 23:59 HST (Hawaii Time).

Important Notes
Poster papers will appear in supplementary post-conference proceedings 
to be published by Springer in the series Lecture Notes in Computer 
Science (LNCS).
Participants with an accepted poster must register for the conference 
and present their work during the Poster Session. A space will be 
allocated for each participant. The organizers should be contacted well 
in advance of the conference in case of any special requirement.
