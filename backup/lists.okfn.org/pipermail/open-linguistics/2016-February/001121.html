#SEMANTiCS 2016 Scientific Workshops Scope &amp; Goals
SEMANTiCS 2016 scientific workshops provide a forum for groups of 
researchers and practitioners to discuss topics in semantic web research 
and industrial applications. They provide opportunities for researchers 
and practitioners to exchange and discuss scientific and engineering 
ideas before these ideas have matured to warrant conference or journal 
publication. SEMANTiCS 2016 scientific workshops also serve as 
incubators for scientific communities that form and share a particular 
research agenda.
The workshops may be either half or full day long and will be held on 
the day before the main SEMANTiCS 2016 conference (September 12th, 
2016). Participation in SEMANTiCS 2016 scientific workshops is typically 
free. The workshops can produce workshop proceedings to be published in 
CEUR Workshop Proceedings (<A HREF="http://ceur-ws.org/">http://ceur-ws.org/</A>). The best accepted 
workshop papers will be considered for publication in the SEMANTiCS 2016 
conference proceedings, furthermore, a selection of workshop papers will 
be invited to present a poster at the SEMANTiCS 2016 conference.

#Scientific Workshop Proposal Submissions

#About SEMANTiCS
The annual SEMANTiCS conference is the meeting place for researchers and 
professionals who push the boundaries of semantic computing and who 
understand its benefits and encounter its limitations. Every year, 
SEMANTiCS attracts professionals and researchers alike ranging from 
NPOs, through public administrations to the largest companies in the 
world. SEMANTiCS workshop attendees learn from industry experts and top 
researchers about emerging trends and hot topics in the fields of 
semantic software, enterprise data, linked data &amp; open data strategies, 
methodologies in knowledge modelling and text &amp; data analytics. Since 
the SEMANTiCS community is highly diverse, both workshops participants 
and organisers will benefit from the experience.

The success of last year&#8217;s conference in Vienna with more than 280 
attendees from 22 countries proves that SEMANTiCS 2016 will continue a 
long tradition of bringing together colleagues from around the world. 
There will be presentations on industry implementations, use case 
prototypes, best practices, panels, papers and posters to discuss 
semantic systems in birds-of-a-feather sessions as well as informal 
settings. SEMANTiCS addresses problems common among information 
managers, software engineers, IT-architects and various specialist 
departments working to develop, implement and/or evaluate semantic 
software systems.
The SEMANTiCS program is a rich mix of technical talks, panel 
discussions of important topics and presentations by people who make 
things work - just like you. In addition, attendees can network with 
experts in a variety of fields. These relationships provide great value 
to organisations as they encounter subtle technical issues in any stage 
of implementation. The expertise gained by SEMANTiCS attendees has a 
long-term impact on their careers and organisations. These factors make 
SEMANTiCS the major industry related event across Europe for our community.
