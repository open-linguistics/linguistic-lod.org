Description
-----------

Recent years have witnessed an upsurge in the quantity of available digital
research data, offering new insights and opportunities for improved
understanding. Following advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Text
and data mining (TDM) is emerging as an invaluable tool for harnessing the
power of structured and unstructured content and data. Hidden and new
knowledge can be discovered by using TDM at multiple levels and in multiple
dimensions. However, text mining and NLP solutions are not easy to discover
and use, nor are they easy to combine for end users.

Multiple efforts are being undertaken world-wide to create TDM and NLP
platforms. These platforms are targeted at specific research communities,
typically researchers in a particular location, e.g. OpenMinTeD, 
CLARIN (Europe), ALVEO (Australia), or LAPPS (USA). All of these platforms 
face similar problems in the following areas: discovery of content and 
analytics capabilities, integration of knowledge resources, legal and 
licensing aspects, data representation, and analytics workflow specification 
and execution. 

The goal of cross-platform interoperability raises many problems. At the level
of content, metadata, language resources, and text annotations, we use
different data representations and vocabularies. At the level of workflows,
there is no uniform process model that allows platforms to smoothly interact.
The licensing status of content, resources, analytics, and of the output
created by a combination of such licenses is difficult to determine and there
is currently no way to reliably exchange such information between platforms.
User identity management is often tightly coupled to the licensing requirements
and likewise an impediment for cross-platform interoperability.


Target audience
---------------

Language resources and technologies, NLP, computational linguistics, and text
mining communities as well as their associated infrastructural initiatives.


Motivation and Topics of interest
---------------------------------

Workshop topics include but are not limited to:

&#8226; cross-repository discovery of content, language resources, and analytics
&#8226; uniform access to content repositories or heterogeneous data sources 
 (content, knowledge)
&#8226; extraction of textual content from heterogeneous sources
&#8226; orchestration of analytics workflows composed from analytics from 
 different sources
&#8226; orchestration of cross-platform analytics workflows
&#8226; linking knowledge sources and uniformly accessing them from analytics
 workflows
&#8226; annotation schema design best practices
&#8226; mapping and transformation between annotation schemata
&#8226; dynamic deployment of analytics to computing resources
&#8226; machine-interpretable representation of legal and licensing metadata
&#8226; policy making for TDM for an international open research environment
 and open access publishing


Format
------

The workshop is planned as an open-space event in which the workshop
participants host and participate in discussions related to the topics of
interest.

We invite submissions of extended abstracts/short papers describing recent
work, thoughts, or best practices on one or more of the topics of interest (up
to 4 pages). All submissions will be reviewed using a simple blind process by
at least three programm committee members and will be assessed based on their
relevance, potential to create constructive discussion, and clarity of
writing. The submissions must be formatted in compliance with the style sheet
that will be adopted for the LREC Proceedings (to be announced later on the
Conference web site).

Accepted papers will be presented at the workshop in the form of a 5 minute
lightning talk and included in the workshop proceedings. If there is an
unexpectedly high number of submissions, we may consider accepting some as
posters. 

At least one author of each paper is expected to register for the workshop.
During the workshop, the author is expected to host or co-host a discussion
group. We plan to align the topics of the discussion groups with the topics
of the authors submissions. The hosts will take minutes which are to be
aggregated into a report after the workshop. We wish to encourage authors
to offer their help in the report writing process to the organizing committee.


Important dates
---------------

&#8226; Submission: February 19, 2016
&#8226; Notification: March 4, 2016&#8203;
&#8226; Camera ready: March 25, 2016
&#8226; Workshop: &#8203;Monday, 23 May 2016&#8203;


Share your LRs!
---------------

Describing your LRs in the LRE Map is now a normal practice in the submission
procedure of LREC (introduced in 2010 and adopted by other conferences). To
continue the efforts initiated at LREC 2014 about &#8220;Sharing LRs&#8221; (data, tools,
web-services, etc.), authors will have the possibility,  when submitting a
paper, to upload LRs in a special LREC repository.  This effort of sharing
LRs, linked to the LRE Map for their description, may become a new &quot;regular&quot;
feature for conferences in our field, thus contributing to creating a common
repository where everyone can deposit and share data.


Identify, Describe and Share your LRs
-------------------------------------

As scientific work requires accurate citations of referenced work so as to
allow the community to understand the whole context and also replicate the
experiments conducted by other researchers, LREC 2016 endorses the need to
uniquely Identify LRs through the use of the International Standard Language
Resource Number (ISLRN, www.islrn.org), a Persistent Unique Identifier to be
assigned to each Language Resource. The assignment of ISLRNs to LRs cited in
LREC papers  will be offered at submission time.
