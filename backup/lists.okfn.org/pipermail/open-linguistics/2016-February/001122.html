#SEMANTiCS Industry &amp; Transfer Tutorials and Workshops
SEMANTiCS 2016 is a major venue for industrial innovation and features 
an industry &amp; transfer tutorial and workshop program addressing the 
diverse practical interests of its audience. This program is intended to 
offer a rich diversity of high quality information valuable to 
conference attendees and local participants seeking to pick up new 
skills and stay up-to-date regarding the latest developments in the 
community. We encourage submissions of proposals on all topics in the 
general areas of SEMANTiCS 2016 and proposals bridging or introducing 
new perspectives in these areas. Tutorials and workshops may incorporate 
panel discussions, lightning talks, meetings, networking or hands-on 
sessions, hackathons, and other practical formats where applicable. 
Rooms for business or project meetings are available upon request as well.

#SEMANTiCS 2016 Tutorials and Workshop Scope &amp; Goals
Satellite events at SEMANTiCS 2016 allow your organisation or project to 
push your topics and gain increased visibility.  The workshop and 
tutorials will be announced on the SEMANTiCS and DBpedia website 
(tutorials only) and will be seen by all participants. SEMANTiCS 2016  
industry &amp; transfer tutorials and workshops are incubators for 
industrial and scientific communities that form and share a particular 
research and development agenda. They provide a forum for presenting 
widely recognized contributions and findings to a diverse and 
knowledgeable community. Furthermore, the event can be used as a 
dissemination activity in the scope of large research projects or as a 
closed format for research/commercial project consortia meetings.

#Setup and requirements of SEMANTiCS Workshops and Tutorials
SEMANTiCS 2016 workshops and tutorials may be either half or full day 
long. Workshops will be held on the day before the main SEMANTiCS 2016 
conference (September 12, 2016), Tutorials will be held after the 
conference (September 15, 2016) in parallel to the DBpedia Day.

#About SEMANTiCS
The annual SEMANTiCS conference is the meeting place for researchers and 
professionals who push the boundaries of semantic computing and who 
understand its benefits and encounter its limitations. Every year, 
SEMANTiCS attracts professionals and researchers alike ranging from 
NPOs, through public administrations to the largest companies in the world.
The success of last year&#8217;s conference in Vienna with more than 280 
attendees from 22 countries proves that SEMANTiCS 2016 will continue a 
long tradition of bringing together colleagues from around the world. 
There will be presentations on industry implementations, use case 
prototypes, best practices, panels, papers and posters to discuss 
semantic systems in birds-of-a-feather sessions as well as informal 
settings. SEMANTiCS addresses problems common among information 
managers, software engineers, IT-architects and various specialist 
departments working to develop, implement and/or evaluate semantic 
software systems.
The SEMANTiCS program is a rich mix of technical talks, panel 
discussions of important topics and presentations by people who make 
things work - just like you. In addition, attendees can network with 
experts in a variety of fields. These relationships provide great value 
to organisations as they encounter subtle technical issues in any stage 
of implementation. The expertise gained by SEMANTiCS attendees has a 
long-term impact on their careers and organisations. These factors make 
SEMANTiCS the major industry related event across Europe for our community.
