<PRE>Dear all,

it's been a while since we had the last telco, partly due to a number of
events we organized (and are organizing), partly due to the summer break,
i.e., the conference season.

Hence, it's time to discuss impressions and outcomes of recent events such
as the First Language, Data and Knowledge conference (LDK-2017), the 2nd
Summer Datathon on Linguistic Linked Open Data (SD-LLOD 2017), as well as
on-going activities, but more importantly, to formally take up
preparations for the 6th Workshop on Linked Data in Linguistics (LDL-2018)
that we plan to submit to LREC-2018. Unfortunately, the deadline for this
is already end of September, so a telco is to be scheduled within the next
two weeks.

So, if you want to participate in LDL organization, or you're interested
in the topics of Open Linguistics, recent developments and upcoming
sensations, please participate in the Doodle poll below and join our next
telco.

<A HREF="https://doodle.com/poll/sr7icgeyb498nh6c">https://doodle.com/poll/sr7icgeyb498nh6c</A>

If you want to participate, please make sure to join the poll or respond
directly via email to express your interest. Also, make sure we know your
Skype login: As in the last telcos, we will start the meeting as a Skype
chat, but probably eventually use hangouts for talking (and share the link
via Skype chat).

I am aware of possible conflicts with related events such as SEMANTICS-
2018, so, in case you're not available for a telco, but interested to
participate in LDL organization, please drop me a line.

Best regards,
Christian
