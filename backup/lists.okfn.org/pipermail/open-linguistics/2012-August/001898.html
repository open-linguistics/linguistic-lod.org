<PRE>Dear Christian,
I was aware of the very loose initial requirements and I am also aware 
that the barrier to get 5 star linked data ( <A HREF="http://5stardata.info/">http://5stardata.info/</A> ) is 
high ( especially since there is actual work required ) .  This was ok 
as long as we assumed the &quot;draft&quot; status for the image. Now, I think the 
time is ripe to make a &quot;real&quot; one . What really changed now is that 
through MLODE we have some resources to provide help. So you might call 
my criteria 'hard', but not 'unfair' and I am the last one that wouldn't 
offer help (or try to organize help) in case anybody who promised and 
wants to join, gets left behind.

In particular, I created the image to remind the people that *have* the 
know-how and technical ability to really live what they pray and now and 
then do something small towards removing the &quot;draft&quot; on the cloud.

In reply to CKAN: To add a data set, you barely have to enter anything 
at first. Since it is a Wiki you can just start by almost nothing and 
then gradually you or other people can improve the page following a &quot;pay 
as you go&quot; or &quot;release early, release often&quot; methodology [1]. For 
example,  I created the page for OLiA just now: 
<A HREF="http://thedatahub.org/dataset/olia">http://thedatahub.org/dataset/olia</A>
Basically I needed to add:
1.  a name, i.e. &quot;OLiA&quot; and
2. a description -&gt; &quot;ontologies of linguistic annotation&quot; and
3. I tagged it with &quot;linguistics&quot; for now.
4. Additionally, I added a &quot;resource&quot;. In this case, it is a link to the 
HTML download page: <A HREF="http://olia.nlp2rdf.org">http://olia.nlp2rdf.org</A>
(I didn't check, but even adding a resource is not strictly required)

So creating CKAN entries is really not that hard and I am trying to find 
out what is holding people up?

All the best,
Sebastian

&gt;<i> Hi Sebastian, dear all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> thank you very much for the initiative and for coordinating support for
</I>&gt;<i> RDF conversion of potential LLOD candidates.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just for clarification: I wouldn't describe the result of your survey as
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;shocking&quot;, but simply conformant to the (indeed!) *very loose*
</I>&gt;<i> requirement currently applied for inclusion in the LLOD diagram draft. 
</I>&gt;<i> The
</I>&gt;<i> requirement for the current draft was only that data providers *promise*
</I>&gt;<i> RDF conversion, open publication and linking, but not necessarily have
</I>&gt;<i> performed it yet. The idea was that interested colleagues from the group
</I>&gt;<i> may help with conversion and/or linking as soon as the bubble and its
</I>&gt;<i> potential linking has been announced (and in a few cases, this seems 
</I>&gt;<i> to be
</I>&gt;<i> underway -- I'm thinking of John and Judith here).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, this is precisely why it is referred to as &quot;draft&quot;, see the 
</I>&gt;<i> LREC
</I>&gt;<i> paper (<A HREF="http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2012">http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2012</A>), Sect. 4.11. I 
</I>&gt;<i> think
</I>&gt;<i> everyone agrees that it would be great to shift from draft to official
</I>&gt;<i> status as soon as possible, and the MLODE workshop might bring us a leap
</I>&gt;<i> forward towards this goal, but at the moment, &quot;draft&quot; explicitly allows
</I>&gt;<i> the following resources to be included:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - no RDF available
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - no links
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - no data online
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - too many bugs (e.g. Glottolog)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - no CKAN/datahub entry (e.g. ISOcat)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> it would be great to have a CKAN moderator to take care of this. Until
</I>&gt;<i> then, it is basically the responsibility of the data provider to take 
</I>&gt;<i> care
</I>&gt;<i> of this, and ths might represent a (albeit small) obstacle. We discussed
</I>&gt;<i> that recently, wasn't there a volunteer ? At the moment, what we have
</I>&gt;<i> instead is a spreadsheet of candidates, and the task is mostly to 
</I>&gt;<i> transfer
</I>&gt;<i> and update this information. However, CKAN registration also requires to
</I>&gt;<i> provide contact information, and this means that (if deemed necessary) to
</I>&gt;<i> contact the authors whether they would agree to have their contact data
</I>&gt;<i> published, or to provide alternative contact information (for open
</I>&gt;<i> resources, this could be person who registers the resource).
</I>&gt;<i> For me, providing contact information about third parties has been the
</I>&gt;<i> reason to hesitate with the CKAN registration.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The situation is different with
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - only schematic information (e.g. GOLD)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for the specific case of GOLD (and ISOcat, OLiA, lexvo and lingvo), it
</I>&gt;<i> certainly does not qualify as schema, but it formalizes domain-specific
</I>&gt;<i> terminology (that, incidentially, happens to be relevant to NLP tools,
</I>&gt;<i> although comparable repositories without NLP relevance are in existence,
</I>&gt;<i> e.g. <A HREF="http://www.ids-mannheim.de/gra/grammis.html,">http://www.ids-mannheim.de/gra/grammis.html,</A> see the &quot;Ontologie zur
</I>&gt;<i> deutschen Grammatik&quot;). If the domain was not linguistic terminology, but
</I>&gt;<i> pizza recipes, it would count as independent resource, and so should 
</I>&gt;<i> these
</I>&gt;<i> resources.
</I>&gt;<i>     From these, only the OLiA Annotation Models may be considered to 
</I>&gt;<i> contain
</I>&gt;<i> schema information (as they describe annotations in a corpus or produced
</I>&gt;<i> by an NLP tool), but the OLiA Reference Model is certainly not a schema,
</I>&gt;<i> but a terminology repository, and so are GOLD and (even though
</I>&gt;<i> semi-structured only) ISOcat. To put it in other words, these resources
</I>&gt;<i> indeed formalize knowledge about a domain (linguistic terminology), which
</I>&gt;<i> is not restricted to its use in corpora, etc., although it can be (and 
</I>&gt;<i> is)
</I>&gt;<i> also applied for this purpose.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All the best,
</I>&gt;<i> Christian
</I>&gt;<i>
