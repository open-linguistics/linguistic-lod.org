<PRE>Dear all,

we just finalized the OWLG paper on linguistic databases+corpora (the
&quot;OWLG II&quot; paper). As for the project note in the LREJ paper, the original
idea we discussed before LREC was to have an updated, shortened version of
the LREC (aka &quot;OWLG I&quot;) paper with less emphasis on individual projects,
and some sections being rewritten from scratch. I will contribute, of
course, especially with respect to (re)formulation of goals and vision, so
if you have initiated a dedicated mail thread, please forward me that, and
add me to cc in forthcoming publications.

As for the scope, it is actually too early to have a dedicated LLOD
publication. This may change after MLODE, but right now, we are still at
draft stage, and only few of the announced resources are actually available
(please keep in mind: the condition for LLOD draft inclusion was only that
the people *promise* to release their data under an open license and its
RDF conversion. This is to change, of course, as soon as we give up the
draft status, but at the moment, *this* is the requirement.)

As for the SVN: Thanks to Sebastian for offering this. Yet, is there any
need not to use the unfuddle SVN we used for the other publications ? It
is not ideal, because it does not come with user management, but last
time, there was an issue with Sebastian (H.)'s SVN with adding more people
for forthcoming OWLG publications. Has this been solved ?

Best,
Christian
