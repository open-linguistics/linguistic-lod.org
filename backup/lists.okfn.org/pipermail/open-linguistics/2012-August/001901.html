<PRE>&gt;<i> I was aware of the very loose initial requirements and I am also aware that
</I>&gt;<i> the barrier to get 5 star linked data ( <A HREF="http://5stardata.info/">http://5stardata.info/</A> ) is high (
</I>&gt;<i> especially since there is actual work required ) .  This was ok as long as
</I>&gt;<i> we assumed the &quot;draft&quot; status for the image. Now, I think the time is ripe
</I>&gt;<i> to make a &quot;real&quot; one . What really changed now is that through MLODE we have
</I>&gt;<i> some resources to provide help. So you might call my criteria 'hard', but
</I>&gt;<i> not 'unfair' and I am the last one that wouldn't offer help (or try to
</I>&gt;<i> organize help) in case anybody who promised and wants to join, gets left
</I>&gt;<i> behind.
</I>
I know that, and I'm not criticising the introduction of harder
criteria, this definitely needs to be done at some point.

But this discussion should have started in a different way: (1)
Publicly suggesting to adopt (and to define) harder criteria and (2)
asking people about their ideas for a timeline.

I guess this may have happened in MLODE discussions or the last skype
meeting (which I -- unfortunately -- missed), but it is not documented
(not even in the minutes from the skype meeting), and for changes of
that scale, we *really* should use the mailing list to
announce/discuss them, and the wiki for documentation, because
otherwise people just get lost in the process.
