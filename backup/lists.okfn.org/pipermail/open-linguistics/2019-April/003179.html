We invite applications for two fully-funded 4-year PhD positions in natural
language processing at the Data Science Institute of the National
University of Ireland Galway. These positions will focus on the development
of new natural language processing models for minority and historical
languages using deep learning.

The Data Science Institute (DSI) of the National University of Ireland,
Galway [1] hosts the Insight Centre for Data Analytics,[2] a collaboration
between several universities in Ireland. Insight is the biggest dedicated
research centre in data analytics in Europe. Both positions will be
associated with the Unit for Linguistic Data [3] at DSI/Insight.

The work is part of the Cardamom project on the development of &#8220;Comparative
Deep Models for Minority and Historical Languages&#8221;. The PhDs will be
involved in the development of the project. in particular:


   -

   Collection and management of resources for minority and historical
   languages
   -

   Development of multilingual lexicons for minority and historical
   languages
   -

   Linguistic linked open data models for minority and historical languages
   -

   Engaging with speakers of minority languages
   -

   Developing gameified language learning tools
   -

   Tokenization, lemmatization and basic processing of historical languages
   -

   Diachronic modelling of language change


Candidates for this position should have a MSc or equivalent in a relevant
field of study with an emphasis on areas such as machine learning, natural
language processing or linguistics. The candidate should have good
programming skills in Python or Java (and preferably experience with
Tensorflow or other deep learning tools). PhD students at the Insight
Centre for Data Analytics will receive a tax-free stipend of EUR 18,000 per
year (EUR 1500 per month) for four years, in addition to university fees.
The position is available to start between the 1st June and 1st October
2019.

Send your application (CV and cover letter, both in PDF only) by 1st May
2019 to Dr. John P. McCrae &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-linguistics">john.mccrae at insight-centre.org</A>&gt;.
