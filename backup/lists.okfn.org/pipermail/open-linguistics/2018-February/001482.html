**********************************************************************************

&#160;
AIMS:

&#160;

SLSP is a yearly conference series aimed at promoting and displaying excellent research on the wide spectrum of statistical methods that are currently in use in computational language or speech processing. It aims at attracting contributions from both fields. Though there exist large, well-known conferences and workshops hosting contributions to any of these areas, SLSP is a more focused meeting where synergies between subdomains and people will hopefully happen. In SLSP 2018, significant room will be reserved to young scholars at the beginning of their career and particular focus will be put on methodology.

&#160;
VENUE:

&#160;

SLSP 2018 will take place in Mons, which was European Capital of Culture in 2015. The venue will be:
