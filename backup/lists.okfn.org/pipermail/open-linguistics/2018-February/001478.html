<PRE>Call For Papers

Seventh International Conference on Future Generation Communication 
Technologies (FGCT 2018)
Luton, UK
August 20-22, 2018
<A HREF="http://www.socio.org.uk/fgct">http://www.socio.org.uk/fgct</A>
Technically co-sponsored by UK &amp; RI IEEE

In the last decade, a number of newer communication technologies have 
been evolved, which have a significant impact on the technology, as a 
whole. The impact ranges from incremental applications to dramatical 
breakthrough in the society. Users rely heavily on broadcast technology, 
social media, mobile devices, video games and other innovations to 
enrich the learning and adoption process.

The Seventh International Conference on Future Generation Communication 
Technologies (FGCT 2018) conference is designed for teachers, 
administrators, practitioners, researchers and scientists in the 
development arenas. It aims to provide discussions and simulations in 
the communication technology at the broad level and broadcasting 
technology and related technologies at the micro level. Through a set of 
research papers, using innovative and interactive approach, participants 
can expect to share a set of research that will prepare them to apply 
new technologies to their work in teaching, research and educational 
development amid this rapidly evolving landscape.

Topics discussed in this platform are not limited to-

  Emerging cellular and new network architectures for 5G
  New antenna and RF technology for 5G wireless
