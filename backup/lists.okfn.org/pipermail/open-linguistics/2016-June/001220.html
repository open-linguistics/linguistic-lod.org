<PRE>********************************************
  15th International Semantic Web Conference
            October 17-21, 2016
                Kobe, Japan
      <A HREF="http://iswc2016.semanticweb.org">http://iswc2016.semanticweb.org</A>

          Call for Posters and Demos
********************************************

The ISWC 2016 Posters and Demonstrations complement the paper tracks of 
the conference and offer an opportunity for presenting late-breaking 
research results, on-going research projects, and speculative or 
innovative work in progress. The informal setting of the Posters and 
Demonstrations encourages presenters and participants to engage in 
discussions about the work. Such discussions can be invaluable inputs 
for the future work of the presenters, while offering participants an 
effective way to broaden their knowledge of the emerging research trends 
and to network with other researchers.

We invite submissions relevant to the area of the Semantic Web and which 
address, but are not limited to, the topics of the Research Track; the 
Application Track; and the Resource Track. Technical posters, reports on 
Semantic Web software systems (free or commercial), descriptions of 
completed work, and work in progress are all welcome. Demonstrations are 
intended to showcase innovative Semantic Web related implementations and 
technologies, both in academia and in industry.

We explicitly welcome entries from the industry. However, submissions 
for posters and demos should go beyond pure advertisements of commercial 
software packages and convey a minimal scientific contribution.

Authors of full papers accepted for the Research Track; the Application 
Track; and the Resource Track are explicitly invited to submit a 
demonstration. The submission should be formatted as the other posters 
and demonstrations but must cite the accepted full paper and needs to 
include an explanation of its added value with respect to the conference 
paper. The added value could include: a) extended results and 
experiments not presented in the conference paper for reasons of space, 
or b) a demonstration of a supporting prototype implementation.
Submission Information

Authors must submit a four-page extended abstract for evaluation. All 
submissions will undergo a common review process, including those 
related to already accepted full papers. For demonstrations, authors are 
strongly encouraged to include in their submission a link to where the 
demo (live or recorded video) can be found. They should also make clear 
what exactly will be demonstrated to the participants (e.g., what 
datasets will be used, which functionalities will be shown).

All submissions must be made electronically via the EasyChair conference 
submission system:
<A HREF="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iswc2016pd">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iswc2016pd</A>

Submissions must use the PDF file format and must adopt the style of the 
Springer Publications format for Lecture Notes in Computer Science 
(LNCS). Details are provided on Springer's Author Instructions page. 
Submissions that exceed the page limit will be rejected without review. 
For details on the HTML format, see the HTML submission guide.

At least one of the authors must be a registered participant at the 
conference, and attend the Poster/Demo Session to present the work. The 
abstracts of accepted posters and demonstrations will be given to all 
conference attendees and published on the conference web site, but will 
not be published by Springer in the printed conference proceedings. They 
will, however, be compiled into a CEUR-WS Proceedings for easy Web 
retrieval and archival.

Metadata for all successful submissions will be included in the 
conference metadata corpus. Detailed information about metadata creation 
will be provided with the acceptance notification of the successful 
submissions.

As in previous years, student-authors of accepted papers will be able to 
apply for travel support to attend the conference.

Review Criteria

All papers submitted to the Posters &amp; Demos Track will be reviewed by at 
least three program committee members. Decisions about acceptance will 
be based on relevance to the Semantic Web, originality, potential 
significance, relevance, and clarity. The purpose of the track is to 
allow the presentation of preliminary results to the community, provided 
that originality and significance of the contribution are ensured. 
Authors submitting a demo are strongly encouraged to include in the 
paper a pointer to the online demo or video of the application to be 
presented. The absence of a pointer will affect the overall evaluation 
of the paper.

Important Dates

* Poster &amp; Demo Submission: July 7th, 2016
* Notifications: August 7th, 2016
* Camera-Ready Versions: August 30th, 2016
All deadlines are midnight Hawaii time.

Posters and Demos Track Chairs

* Takahiro Kawamura, Japan Science and Technology Agency, Japan
* Heiko Paulheim, University of Mannheim, Germany
