Introduction
What kind of smart applications can we build, if we were able to
integrate all available knowledge, data and language resources in a
meaningful way? In order to realize the dream of artificial
intelligence, it is necessary to focus on knowledge engineering to build
information machines that enable humans to perform more efficiently in
their tasks. To achieve this goal, we believe the following two
prerequisites must be met:
* Knowledge and data must be rendered in a discoverable way and then
transformed, linked, enriched and integrated homogeneously in a huge
semantic knowledge graph
* Language technologies must first be leveraged in order to understand,
categorize and structure available textual content in all its forms.
Then, language technology must assist in building adequate interfaces
that allow humans to interact effectively with data and information via
discovery, querying and reorganization.
Research in this workshop focuses on contextualising data and ontologies
as well as capturing deep linguistic knowledge to improve machine
understanding.


Purpose and scope
Some international initiatives such as the LIDER European project
(www.lider-project.eu &lt;<A HREF="http://www.lider-project.eu">http://www.lider-project.eu</A>&gt;  ) and the W3C OntoLex, BPMLOD, and LD4LT community
groups, as well as the Open Knowledge Foundation (OKFN) Working Group
for Open Data in Linguistics (OWLG), have promoted an ecosystem of
linguistic linked open data (LLOD)
One of the main motivations of this workshop is to move the LLOD cloud
to its next phase in which innovative applications will be developed
overcoming the language barriers on the Web.


The K&#201;KI workshop is targeted at anyone interested in Semantic Web,
Linguistics and Natural Language Processing technologies and we are
especially welcoming submissions focussing on either domain topics or
technological topics or both.

Domain Topics
* Data related to Linguistics and NLP:
** language resource such as, but not limited to: corpora, treebanks, dictionaries and lexicographical resources
* Linguistic and NLP Ontologies
** proposals for novel models or extension of existing models such as lemon, NIF, POWLA, MARL, NERD
* Linguistic linked open data
** metadata, license issues, indexes, collections, repositories, workflows that deal with Linguistic LOD as a whole
* Web services and tools ingesting or producing linguistic linked data and annotations


Technological Topics

* Knowledge Integration
** Vocabularies and Models for integrating resources (and Ontology Engineering)
** Dataset metrics and quality assessment
** Query federation and question answering
** Metadata for linked data knowledge
** Discoverability of data

* Knowledge Extraction
** NLP techniques for knowledge extraction and machine reading
** Information extraction and ontology learning
** Pattern recognition and extraction for IE
** Resources and use cases
** Approaches using mappings and their maintenance from structured
sources (RDB, XML, JSON), from semistructured sources (XHTML), from
unstructured sources (Text)


Submission Guidelines
________________


We invite submissions in the form of regular long and short papers.


All workshop papers must represent original and unpublished work that is
not currently under review. Papers will be evaluated according to their
significance, originality, technical content, style, clarity, and
relevance to the workshop. At least one author of each accepted paper is
expected to attend the workshop upon acceptance. Submission is
single-blind, i.e. author names are visible, only reviewers stay anonymous.
All papers should follow the LNCS guidelines for formatting and must not
exceed 16 pages in length for long papers and 12 pages for short papers
including references and excluding appendices. The layout templates are
available for download from the Springer website at
<A HREF="https://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0">https://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0</A>  which also
contains MS Office/Word instructions. The file format for submissions is
Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF). Other formats will not be accepted.
We have applied jointly together with the NLP &amp; DBpedia Workshop for
publication in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science Series (LNCS) by
Springer and are currently under review.  Submissions must be uploaded
electronically by the submission deadline July 1st 2016 through
EasyChair at:<A HREF="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=kki2016">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=kki2016</A>
For any inquiries regarding the submission process or the workshop in
general, please send an email to our public mailing list at
<A HREF="https://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-linguistics">keki2016 at linguistic-lod.org</A> &lt;mailto:<A HREF="https://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-linguistics">keki2016 at linguistic-lod.org</A>&gt;.


We are looking forward for meeting you at K&#201;KI 2016!
