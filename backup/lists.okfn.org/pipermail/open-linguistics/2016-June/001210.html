<PRE>Call for Papers:
Workshop on Deep Language Processing for Quality Machine Translation
(DeepLP4QMT)
Varna, Bulgaria, 10 September 2016
This one day workshop will be held in conjunction with
The 17th International Conference
on
Artificial Intelligence:
Methodology, Systems, Applications - AIMSA 2016
Varna, Bulgaria, 7-9 September 2016

Motivation
In the last decade, research on language technology applications, such as
machine translation (MT), information retrieval and extraction (also
cross-lingual), etc. has benefited from the significant advances obtained
with the exploitation of increasingly sophisticated statistical approaches.
To a large extent, this advancement has been achieved also by encompassing a
host of subsidiary and increasingly more fine-grained linguistic
distinctions at the syntactic and semantic levels.

Thus, the NLP mainstream has headed towards the modeling of multilayered
linguistic knowledge. To leap forward in terms of the quality of its output,
machine translation and other technologies are taking advantage of enhanced
capacities for deeper analysis of natural language and massive open online
world knowledge that are now becoming available. The following initiatives
can be mentioned as best practices, among others:

** LOGON MT system from-Norwegian-to-English which uses Minimal Recursion
Semantics (MRS) and DELPH-IN deep HPSG grammar expertise for language
transfer;
** Systems based on Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR);
** The ParGram parallel deep grammars and parsebanks covering several
language families in the LFG formalism;
** The development of sophisticated syntactic and semantic models, sensitive
to lexical semantics and semantic roles;
** Creation of high-quality parallel treebanks via model transfers (such as
Prague Czech-English Dependency treebank);
** Creation of deep resources, such as English DeepBank, released in 2013;
** Creation of common tagsets and thus &#8216;universalizing&#8217; linguistic
resources, such as the Universal dependencies initiative, etc.

In the long run, richer world knowledge will be available, even beyond the
current Linked Open Data, with respect to larger datasets, semantics
enhanced with world facts, and more dynamic conceptual knowledge
representation. Concomitantly, the evolutive trend in Natural Language
Processing shows a strong integration of the knowledge-poor language
processing with the knowledge-rich one, supported by deep grammars and deep
language resources.

The workshop invites papers on the use of deep natural language
processing and resources providing deep analyses for a range of applications
including, but not limited to, machine translation.

Topics of interest

** Deep MT transfer models
** Deep processing of source language
** Deep generation using world knowledge models and/or deep grammars
** Deep learning for quality machine translation
** MT and IR supported by Linked Open Data
** Language resources for quality machine translation
** Modeling deep linguistic knowledge for quality applications
** Statistical models for quality MT and other NLP-related tasks
** Development and exploitation of monolingual and parallel deep language
resources: deep grammars, parsebanks, propbanks, valency lexicons and other
deep lexical resources, ontologies etc.
** Adaptation of deep language resources to MT and other NLP-related tasks
** Knowledge-based metrics for evaluation

Invited speakers

** Francis Bond, Nanyang Technological University
** Josef van Genabith, DFKI

Important dates

Submission deadline: 27 June 2016
Notification of acceptance: 25 July 2016
Camera-ready papers: 22 August 2016
Workshop date: 10 September 2016

Paper format

Workshop papers will be published as a special issue in the journal
