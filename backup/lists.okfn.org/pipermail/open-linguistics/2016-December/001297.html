THEME OF THE CONFERENCE

======================================================================

Big Data Analytics for Business and Public Administration

The increasing interest in Big Data resulted in the transformation of science, medicine, healthcare, engineering, business, finance, administration and even society. Big Data Analytics helps organisations process their data in order to identify new opportunities. The results might make the business smarter by enabling faster and better decision making, more efficient operations and higher profits, and also lead to more satisfied customers by gauging their needs.

Big Data Analytics helps to understand and enhance enterprises by linking many fields of information technology and business. Moreover, governments are using Big Data Analytics to gain new insights to change the accepted notions of public service, improve quality of life and set new patient-centric standards for healthcare. Thus, BIS 2017 conference will continue the discussion about Big and Smart Data started on the previous editions. We invite researchers and business practitioners to publish the latest results in Big Data Analytics research. Our goal is to inspire you to think outside the box by sharing theoretical and practical knowledge of ongoing Big Data solutions and technologies.
