<PRE>Dear Colleagues,

I am seeking community feedback and expressions of interest regarding a 
proposal for a new type of annotation resource catalog. The idea is 
described briefly in the appended text, and was proposed, discussed, and 
endorsed at an NSF-funded workshop &lt;<A HREF="http://uat2015.cs.fiu.edu/">http://uat2015.cs.fiu.edu/</A>&gt; held 
last year (described in detail in this technical report 
&lt;<A HREF="https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/105270">https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/105270</A>&gt;).

If you have ever done linguistic annotation and have a moment, I would 
very much appreciate if you would fill out this very short survey (3 
questions):

<A HREF="http://online.cs.fiu.edu/survey/index.php?sid=74491&amp;lang=en">http://online.cs.fiu.edu/survey/index.php?sid=74491&amp;lang=en</A>

Responses may remain anonymous, if you wish. If you have any questions, 
please get in touch. Best regards,

Mark

&gt;<i> It is our observation that, despite several ongoing cataloging 
</I>&gt;<i> efforts, researchers still struggle to find, understand, and evaluate 
</I>&gt;<i> the annotation resources available to support their particular 
</I>&gt;<i> annotation tasks (e.g., software tools, schema, and corpora). We 
</I>&gt;<i> propose to develop a new catalog that addresses this problem, which 
</I>&gt;<i> will add important new metadata on top of existing catalogs (e.g., 
</I>&gt;<i> those maintained by LDC, ELRA, OLAC, etc.,with whom we will partner) 
</I>&gt;<i> as well as adding many additional uncatalogued resources.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The key feature of the catalog is to provide new, sophisticated, and 
</I>&gt;<i> formal metadata that allows sophisticated and accurate search for 
</I>&gt;<i> linguistic-annotation-related resources. The metadata will also enable 
</I>&gt;<i> enhanced evaluation of the relevance of resources for a particular 
</I>&gt;<i> annotation task. This metadata is not currently captured anywhere, 
</I>&gt;<i> except insofar as it is described informally in academic publications. 
</I>&gt;<i> The metadata will also enable automatic inference as to what resources 
</I>&gt;<i> are relevant to which linguistic phenomena and annotation tasks. On 
</I>&gt;<i> the front-end the catalog will be a website: it will list linguistic 
</I>&gt;<i> annotation tools, annotation schema and guidelines, and corpora. On 
</I>&gt;<i> the back-end, it will capture formal relationships between these items 
</I>&gt;<i> in specially designed metadata schemes and description languages, 
</I>&gt;<i> which will enable sophisticated search by linguistic phenomenon, 
</I>&gt;<i> software capability, and semantic interoperability.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The catalog will also incorporate a number of useful features:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   * *Wizard Interface for Novices*, that will guide novice users (such
</I>&gt;<i>     as undergraduates, young graduate students, or researchers new to
</I>&gt;<i>     the field) to the tools, schemes, data, and best practices most
</I>&gt;<i>     appropriate for their task.
</I>&gt;<i>   * *Free Text Reviews* which, like modern online shopping sites, will
</I>&gt;<i>     allow researchers to help others evaluate resources.
</I>&gt;<i>   * *Archive of Abandoned Resources*, providing a
</I>&gt;<i>     download-site-of-last-resort for resources that have lost their homes.
</I>&gt;<i>   * *Streamlined Intake and Archiving*, which will allow researchers
</I>&gt;<i>     to quickly and easily add their newly-developed resources to the
</I>&gt;<i>     catalog to enable other researchers to more easily find and cite
</I>&gt;<i>     their resources, as well as to comply with data archiving
</I>&gt;<i>     requirements by funding agencies (e.g., the NSF Data Management Plan).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This idea was proposed and endorsed by a group of 23 researchers in 
</I>&gt;<i> linguistic annotation who gathered at an NSF-funded workshop 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://uat2015.cs.fiu.edu/">http://uat2015.cs.fiu.edu/</A>&gt; held in March 2015 (described in detail 
</I>&gt;<i> in this technical report 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/105270">https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/105270</A>&gt;). We will be soon 
</I>&gt;<i> seeking NSF funding to support the implementation of the idea.
</I>&gt;<i>
