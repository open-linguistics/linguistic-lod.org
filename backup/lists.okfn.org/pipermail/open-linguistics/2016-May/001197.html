INTERNATIONAL SUMMER SCHOOL ON WEB SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

WebST 2016

Bilbao, Spain

July 18-22, 2016

Organized by:
University of Deusto
Rovira i Virgili University

<A HREF="http://grammars.grlmc.com/webst2016/">http://grammars.grlmc.com/webst2016/</A>
*****************************************************************************

--- Early registration deadline: May 28, 2016 ---

********************************************************

AIM:

WebST 2016 is a research training event addressed to graduates and postgraduates in the first steps of their academic career. With a global scope, it aims at updating them about the most recent advances in the critical, multidisciplinary and fast developing area of web studies, which covers a large spectrum of current exciting research and industrial innovation from computing and technologies to social sciences and the humanities and has turned out to be the largest socio-technical infrastructure in human history. Renowned academics and industry pioneers will lecture and share their views with the audience.

Most subareas of web science and technology will be displayed, namely: content analysis and information extraction, information networks, search, data and semantics, ontologies, user behavior and personalization, online communities, social networks, economic transactions, mobility, security and privacy, graph analysis, web mining and applications. Main challenges and opportunities will be identified through 4 keynote lectures, 17 six-hour courses, and 1 round table, which will tackle the most active and promising topics from various perspectives: philosophy, sociology, politics, digital humanities, economics, computer science, engineering and mathematics. The organizers believe outstanding speakers will attract the brightest and most motivated students. Interaction will be a main component of the event. Moreover, an open session will give participants the opportunity to present their own work in progress in 5 minutes.

ADDRESSED TO:

Graduates and postgraduates from around the world. There are no formal pre-requisites in terms of academic degrees. However, since there will be differences in the course levels, specific knowledge background may be assumed for some of them. WebST 2016 is also appropriate for more senior people who want to keep themselves updated on recent developments and future trends. All will surely find it fruitful to listen and discuss with major researchers, scholars, industry leaders and innovators.

REGIME:

In addition to keynotes, at least 2 courses will run in parallel during the whole event. Participants will be able to freely choose the courses they will be willing to attend as well as to move from one to another.
