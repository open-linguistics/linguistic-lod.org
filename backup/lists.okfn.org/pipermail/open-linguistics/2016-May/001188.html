**********************************************************************************

4th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON STATISTICAL LANGUAGE AND SPEECH PROCESSING

SLSP 2016

Pilsen, Czech Republic

October 11-13, 2016

Organized by:

Department of Computer Science and Engineering
Department of Cybernetics
University of West Bohemia

Research Group on Mathematical Linguistics (GRLMC)
Rovira i Virgili University

<A HREF="http://grammars.grlmc.com/SLSP2016/">http://grammars.grlmc.com/SLSP2016/</A>

**********************************************************************************

AIMS:

SLSP is a yearly conference series aimed at promoting and displaying excellent research on the wide spectrum of statistical methods that are currently in use in computational language or speech processing. It aims at attracting contributions from both fields. Though there exist large, well-known conferences and workshops hosting contributions to any of these areas, SLSP is a more focused meeting where synergies between subdomains and people will hopefully happen. In SLSP 2016, significant room will be reserved to young scholars at the beginning of their career and particular focus will be put on methodology.

VENUE:

SLSP 2016 will take place in Pilsen, nominated one of the two European Capitals of Culture in 2015. The venue will be the the&#160;NTIS research centre&#160;at the Faculty of Applied Sciences of the University of West Bohemia.

SCOPE:

The conference invites submissions discussing the employment of statistical models (including machine learning) within language and speech processing. Topics of either theoretical or applied interest include, but are not limited to:

anaphora and coreference resolution
authorship identification, plagiarism and spam filtering
computer-aided translation
corpora and language resources
data mining and semantic web
information extraction
information retrieval
knowledge representation and ontologies
lexicons and dictionaries
machine translation
multimodal technologies
natural language understanding
neural representation of speech and language
opinion mining and sentiment analysis
parsing
part-of-speech tagging
question-answering systems
semantic role labelling
speaker identification and verification
speech and language generation
speech recognition
speech synthesis
speech transcription
spelling correction
spoken dialogue systems
term extraction
text categorisation
text summarisation
user modeling

STRUCTURE:

SLSP 2016 will consist of:

invited talks
peer-reviewed contributions

INVITED SPEAKERS:

Walter Daelemans (University of Antwerp), Advances in Statistical Approaches to Personality Prediction from Text

Julia Hirschberg (Columbia University), Identifying Sentiment and Emotion in Low Resource Languages
