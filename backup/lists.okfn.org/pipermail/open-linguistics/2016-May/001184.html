<PRE>Call for Workshop Papers

Second  International Workshop on 'Internet of Everything'

In Conjunction with the Eleventh  International Conference on Digital 
Information Management (ICDIM 2016)
<A HREF="http://icdim.org/internet.html">http://icdim.org/internet.html</A>
Porto, Portugal
September 19-21, 2106

Technically co-sponsored by the IEEE Technology Engineering Management 
Society

IEEE Xplore.

About the Workshop

The Internet of Everything (IoE) is expected to also make impacts in 
government, education, finance and transportation. On the consumer side 
there are nearly endless combinations of applications. The Internet of 
Things will forever change our personal and professional lives. By 2020, 
there will be 50 billion connected devices communicating through the 
Internet. Devices can range from connected coffee makers, cars, or 
sensors on cattle to connected machines in a production plant. These 
devices provide data that offers new insights, and as they talk to each 
other, they develop their own intelligence and can advise customers 
about optimal ways to put them to use. This will revolutionize consumer 
habits and the way we do work and services.

Realizing the potential of IoE the proposed workshop will address the 
new research and also visulaize the future IoT. The topics the workshop 
address includes but not limited to -
The Internet of Things and Industry 4.0
Smart Services
Sensors
Smart Grid
Effects on Society
Challenges and Opportunities for Society
Business Perspective
Digital Transformation and Business
Smart Software for Smart Services
Enabling Technologies
Challenges and Opportunities for Business
IoT for Supply Chain Management
IoT in Healthcare
