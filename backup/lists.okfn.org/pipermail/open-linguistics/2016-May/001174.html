Introduction
What kind of smart applications can we build, if we were able to 
integrate all available knowledge, data and language resources in a 
meaningful way? In order to realize the dream of artificial 
intelligence, it is necessary to focus on knowledge engineering to build 
information machines that enable humans to perform more efficiently in 
their tasks. To achieve this goal, we believe the following two 
prerequisites must be met:
* Knowledge and data must be rendered in a discoverable way and then 
transformed, linked, enriched and integrated homogeneously in a huge 
semantic knowledge graph
* Language technologies must first be leveraged in order to understand, 
categorize and structure available textual content in all its forms. 
Then, language technology must assist in building adequate interfaces 
that allow humans to interact effectively with data and information via 
discovery, querying and reorganization.
Research in this workshop focuses on contextualising data and ontologies 
as well as capturing deep linguistic knowledge to improve machine 
understanding.


Purpose and scope
Some international initiatives such as the LIDER European project 
(www.lider-project.eu ) and the W3C OntoLex, BPMLOD, and LD4LT community 
groups, as well as the Open Knowledge Foundation (OKFN) Working Group 
for Open Data in Linguistics (OWLG), have promoted an ecosystem of 
linguistic linked open data (LLOD)
One of the main motivations of this workshop is to move the LLOD cloud 
to its next phase in which innovative applications will be developed 
overcoming the language barriers on the Web.


The K&#201;KI workshop is targeted at anyone interested in Semantic Web, 
Linguistics and Natural Language Processing technologies and we are 
especially welcoming submissions focussing on either domain topics or 
technological topics or both.

Domain Topics
* Data related to Linguistics and NLP:
    * language resource such as, but not limited to: corpora, treebanks, 
dictionaries and lexicographical resources
* Linguistic and NLP Ontologies
    * proposals for novel models or extension of existing models such as 
lemon, NIF, POWLA, MARL, NERD
* Linguistic linked open data
    * metadata, license issues, indexes, collections, repositories, 
workflows that deal with Linguistic LOD as a whole
* Web services and tools ingesting or producing linguistic linked data 
and annotations


Technological Topics
* Knowledge Integration
    * Vocabularies and Models for integrating resources (and Ontology 
Engineering)
    * Dataset metrics and quality assessment
    * Query federation and question answering
    * Metadata for linked data knowledge
    * Discoverability of data
* Knowledge Extraction
    * NLP techniques for knowledge extraction and machine reading
    * Information extraction and ontology learning
    * Pattern recognition and extraction for IE
    * Resources and use cases
    * Approaches using mappings and their maintenance from structured 
sources (RDB, XML, JSON), from semistructured sources (XHTML), from 
unstructured sources (Text)


Submission Guidelines
________________


We invite submissions in the form of regular long and short papers.


All workshop papers must represent original and unpublished work that is 
not currently under review. Papers will be evaluated according to their 
significance, originality, technical content, style, clarity, and 
relevance to the workshop. At least one author of each accepted paper is 
expected to attend the workshop upon acceptance. Submission is 
single-blind, i.e. author names are visible, only reviewers stay anonymous.
All papers should follow the LNCS guidelines for formatting and must not 
exceed 16 pages in length for long papers and 12 pages for short papers 
including references and excluding appendices. The layout templates are 
available for download from the Springer website at 
<A HREF="https://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0">https://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0</A> which also 
contains MS Office/Word instructions. The file format for submissions is 
Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF). Other formats will not be accepted.
We have applied jointly together with the NLP &amp; DBpedia Workshop for 
publication in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science Series (LNCS) by 
Springer and are currently under review.  Submissions must be uploaded 
electronically by the submission deadline July 1st 2016 through 
EasyChair at: <A HREF="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=kki2016">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=kki2016</A>
For any inquiries regarding the submission process or the workshop in 
general, please send an email to our public mailing list at 
<A HREF="https://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-linguistics">keki2016 at linguistic-lod.org.</A>


We are looking forward for meeting you at K&#201;KI 2016!
