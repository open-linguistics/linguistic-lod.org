<PRE>CALL FOR PAPERS

Sixth International Conference on Innovating Computing Technology 
(INTECH 2016)
August 24-26, Dublin, Ireland
www.dirf.org/intech
(Technically co-sponsored by UK &amp; Ireland IEEE)
(Xplore publishing)

The First international conference on Innovative Computing Technology 
(INTECH 2011) was held at Sao Carlos in Brazil followed by the Second 
International Conference on Innovative Computing Technology (INTECH 
2012) at Casablanca in Morocco. The INTECH 2013, INTECH 2014 and INTECH 
2015 were organized at London and Luton, UK respectively. The INTECH 
2016 is organized at Dublin, Ireland. The INTECH 2016 offers the opening 
for institutes, research centers, engineers, scientists and industrial 
companies to share their latest investigations, researches, developments 
and ideas in area of Innovative Computing Technology, which covers huge 
topics.

The INTECH intends to address various innovative computing techniques 
involving various applications. This forum will address a large number 
of themes and issues. The conference will feature original research and 
industrial papers on the theory, design and implementation of computing 
technologies, as well as demonstrations, tutorials, workshops and 
industrial presentations. This conference (INTECH 2016) will include 
presentations of contributed papers by invited keynote speakers.

Conference papers will include innovative computing paradigms in the 
following topics:
