<PRE>Dear teacher&#65306;
The 6th Joint International Semantic Technology Conference (JIST 2016)
<A HREF="http://pat.sce.ntu.edu.sg/jist2016/">http://pat.sce.ntu.edu.sg/jist2016/</A>
November 2-4, 2016 (Wed-Fri)
===============================
Recommendation to SCI Journals
The best (candidate) papers of JIST2015 will be invited to present at the
Meet the Editor session of SCI indexed journals, including International
Journal on Semantic Web and Information Systems (IJSWIS). More journals
will be added soon.
===============================

The mission of the Joint International Semantic Technology Conference
(JIST) is to bring together researchers in Semantic Technology research
community and other areas of semantic related technologies to present their
innovative research results or novel applications of semantic technologies.
JIST 2016 in-use track solicits submissions of original work on
applications of semantic technologies and vocabularies. Quality shared
resources such as public ontologies, datasets and software are highly
valuable to the research community, hence, JIST 2016 in-use track also
calls for submissions of public, shared resources of interest to the
Semantic Web community.
**********
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
- Description of an implemented application of semantic technology in a
specific domain
- Description of concrete problems in specific application domains, for
which semantic technology can provide a solution
- Analysis and evaluation of usability and uptake of semantic tools
- Lessons learned and best practices from deploying and using an
application or service based on semantic technology
- Assessment of costs and benefits of implementing, deploying, using, and
managing semantic technology
- Analysis of risks and opportunities of using semantic technology in
organizations with respect to their businesses and customers
- Pragmatics of using or deploying semantic technology in real-world
scenarios
- Comparison of semantic technology with alternative approaches that use
conventional or competing technologies
- Linked Data, open data and vocabularies in production use
- Semantic resources, including but not limited to ontologies, datasets,
benchmarks, and replication studies, services &amp; software
- Semantic technology in new application domains, including: eGovernment,
eHealth, smart cities, life sciences, sensor networks, urban planning,
media and entertainment, telecommunications, cultural heritage, financial
services, energy and utilities, manufacturing, digital libraries, cloud
applications, personal information management, etc.

* Submission
Submissions to JIST 2016 in-use track should describe original, innovative
application of semantic technologies. Submissions to JIST 2016 are expected
to present their claimed contribution, with clear evidence to support their
claims. All submissions will be critically reviewed by at least three
members of the program committee. To assess submissions, reviewers will
judge their relevance to semantic technologies, their originality, the
technical soundness of their proposed approach and the readability of the
submission. JIST 2016 submissions are not anonymous.
JIST 2016 will not accept submissions that are under review for or have
already been published in or accepted for publication in a journal or
another conference. Submissions must be in PDF format, using the style of
the Springer Publications format for Lecture Notes in Computer Science
(LNCS). Submissions must be no longer than *16* pages for the IN-USE TRACK.
Submissions that exceed this limit may be rejected without review.
Submissions that are less than 16 pages can be considered.
Accepted papers will be published in an LNCS proceedings. At least one
author of each accepted paper must register for the conference and present
the paper there.

Papers can be submitted electronically via
<A HREF="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=jist2016.">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=jist2016.</A> Please select the in-use
track when you submit your paper(s).
