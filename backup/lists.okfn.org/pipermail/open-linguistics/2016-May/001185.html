========================================================
CALL FOR WORKSHOP AND TUTORIAL PROPOSALS
20th International Conference on Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge
Management (EKAW 2016)

Workshop and Tutorial days: 19-20 November 2016, Bologna, Italy
Proposal submission: June 3, 2016 (extended)

Web site: <A HREF="http://ekaw2016.cs.unibo.it/?q=call-for-workshops-and-tutorials">http://ekaw2016.cs.unibo.it/?q=call-for-workshops-and-tutorials</A>

========================================================

The International Conference on Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge
Management (EKAW) is concerned with all aspects of eliciting, acquiring,
modeling and managing knowledge, as well its role in the construction of
knowledge-intensive systems and services for the semantic web, knowledge
management, e-business, natural language processing, intelligent
information integration, etc.

Besides a research track, EKAW will host a number of workshops and tutorial
on topics related to the theme of the conference. We hope our workshops to
provide an informal setting where participants have the opportunity to
discuss specific technical topics in an atmosphere that fosters the active
exchange of ideas; and tutorials to enable attendees to fully appreciate
current issues, main schools of thought, and possible application areas.

== TOPICS OF INTEREST ==

In order to meet these goals, workshop/tutorial proposals should address
topics that satisfy the following criteria:

    - the topic falls in the general scope of EKAW 2016 (
<A HREF="http://ekaw2016.cs.unibo.it/?q=callforpapers">http://ekaw2016.cs.unibo.it/?q=callforpapers</A>),
    - there is a clear focus on a specific technology, problem or
application, and
    - there is a sufficiently large community interested in the topic.

== SUBMISSION GUIDELINES ==

Proposals should be submitted via EasyChair, which will be made available
on EKAW&#8217;s web site shortly (<A HREF="http://ekaw2016.cs.unibo.it/">http://ekaw2016.cs.unibo.it/</A>). Submissions
should be a single PDF file of no more than 5 pages, specifying &quot;Workshop
Proposal&quot; or &quot;Tutorial Proposal&quot;, and should contain the following
information.

Workshop  proposals:

    - Title.
    - Abstract (200 words).
    - Motivation on why the topic is of particular interest at this time
and its relation to the main conference topics.
    - Workshop format, discussing the mix of events such as paper
presentations, invited talks, panels, and general discussion.
    - Intended audience and expected number of participants.
    - List of (potential) members of the program committee (at least 25%
have to be confirmed at the time of the proposal, confirmed participants
should be marked specifically).
    - Indication of whether the workshop should be considered for a
half-day or full-day.
    - The tentative dates (submission, notification, camera-ready deadline,
etc.)
    - Past versions of the workshop, including URLs as well as number of
submissions and acceptance rates.
    - Data of the organizers (name, affiliation, email address, homepage)
and short CV.

Additionally

    - we strongly advise having more than one organizer, preferably from
different institutions, bringing different perspectives to the workshop
topic.
    - we welcome, and will prioritise, workshops with creative structures
and organizations that attract various types of contributions and ensure
rich interactions.

Tutorial proposals:

    - Title.
    - Abstract (200 words).
    - Relation to the conference topics, i.e. why it will be of interest to
the conference attendants.
    - If the tutorial, or a very similar tutorial, has been given
elsewhere, explanation of the benefit of presenting it again to the EKAW
community.
    - Overview of content, description of the aims, presentation style,
potential/preferred prerequisite knowledge.
    - Indication on whether the tutorial should be considered for a
half-day or full-day.
    - Intended audience and expected number of participants.
    - Audio-visual or technical requirements and any special room
requirements (for hands-on sessions, any software needed and download sites
must be provided by the tutorial presenters).
    - Data of the presenters (name, affiliation, email address, homepage)
and short CV including also their expertise, experiences in teaching and in
tutorial presentation.

== WORKSHOP ORGANIZERS RESPONSIBILITIES ==

The organizers of accepted workshops are expected to:

    - prepare a workshop webpage (linked to the official EKAW website)
containing the call for papers and detailed information about the workshop
organization and timelines.
    - be responsible for the workshop publicity.
    - be responsible for their own reviewing process, decide upon the final
program content and report the number of submissions and accepted papers to

CEUR-WS website).
    - assure workshop participants are informed they have to register to
the main conference and the workshop.
    - schedule, attend and coordinate their entire workshop.
