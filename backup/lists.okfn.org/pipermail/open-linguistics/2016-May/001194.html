<PRE>Dear teacher&#65306;
The 6th Joint International Semantic Technology Conference (JIST 2016)
<A HREF="http://pat.sce.ntu.edu.sg/jist2016/">http://pat.sce.ntu.edu.sg/jist2016/</A>
November 2-4, 2016 (Wed - Fri)
===============================
Recommendation to SCI Journals
The best (candidate) papers of JIST2015 will be invited to present at the
Meet the Editor session of SCI indexed journals, including International
Journal on Semantic Web and Information Systems (IJSWIS). More journals
will be added soon.
===============================

The mission of the Joint International Semantic Technology Conference
(JIST) is to bring together researchers in Semantic Technology research
community and other areas of semantic related technologies to present their
innovative research results or novel applications of semantic technologies.
JIST 2016 research track solicits submissions of original research work on
semantic technologies and vocabularies.
******

- Semantic Web for P2P, services, agents, grids, and middleware
- Semantic Web for software and systems engineering
- Mobile Semantic Web
- Interface for Semantic Web

* Submission
Submissions to JIST 2016 research track should describe original,
significant research on semantic technologies. Submissions to JIST 2016 are
expected to present their claimed contribution, with clear evidence to
support their claims. All submissions will be critically reviewed by at
least three members of the program committee. To assess submissions,
reviewers will judge their relevance to semantic technologies, their
originality, the technical soundness of their proposed approach and the
readability of the submission. JIST 2016 submissions are not anonymous.
JIST 2016 will not accept submissions that are under review for or have
already been published in or accepted for publication in a journal or
another conference. Submissions must be in PDF format, using the style of
the Springer Publications format for Lecture Notes in Computer Science
(LNCS). Submissions must be no longer than *16* pages for the TECHNICAL
TRACK. Submissions that exceed this limit may be rejected without review.
Accepted papers will be published in an LNCS proceedings. At least one
author of each accepted paper must register for the conference and present
the paper there.

Papers can be submitted electronically via
<A HREF="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=jist2016.">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=jist2016.</A> Please select the
research track when you submit your paper(s).

Important Dates
- Abstract submission: 23:59 (Hawaii Time), July 8, 2016
- Full paper submission: 23:59 (Hawaii Time), July 15, 2016
- Notification of Acceptance: September 15, 2016
- Camera-ready Deadline: September 25, 2016
