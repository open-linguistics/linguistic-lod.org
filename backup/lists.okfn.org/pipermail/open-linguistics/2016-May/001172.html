Researchers are welcome to organize special session.

The conference will list the session on the web. 
The session chair will manage the publicity of his session. 
It is expected that each session will attract 5 registered papers. 
The session chair will get a free registration for one of his papers.

The submission and the reviewing process for the papers of the sessions 
will be managed jointly between the chair and the conference. 
The chair can take the responsibility of the reviewing with the help of other researchers. 
However, the conference will get all the reviewing reports at the end.

** ORGANIZE A WORKSHOP **

BIZ2016 will host several workshops addressing different areas related to 
digital technologies that complement the main BIZ2016 conference. 
Workshops are intended to serve as an intensive collaborative forum for 
exchanging ideas and theories that are still in an evolutionary stage. 
We encourage prospective workshop organizers to submit their proposals 
focusing on either in-depth analysis or broad-ranging approaches to areas 
related to digital technologies.
