<PRE>Apologies for cross-posting
===========================================================
                       13th ESWC 2016
               <A HREF="http://2016.eswc-conferences.org/">http://2016.eswc-conferences.org/</A>
             Call for Minute Madness Presentations
===========================================================

This year's ESWC features a &quot;Minute Madness&quot; session. This is an 
entertaining session that is open for every conference attendee to 
present an idea or a project in one minute using one slide. In 
particular, presenters of demos and posters are encouraged to advertise 
their work and attract attendees to their booth. The session takes place 
on the May 31st, 2016, at 17:30 (local time).

The rules are as follows:
- You have exactly one slide that will be shown for exactly one minute. 
During this one minute you give your talk. If you talk longer, we will 
stop you.
- The slides will be advanced automatically. In between the one-minute 
talks a transition slide will be shown for approximately five seconds. 
This transition slide will be generated by us and it will contain the 
title of the next one-minute talk. The transition slide will include the 
title of the paper and the submission ID.
- Given the limited time, it is highly advisable to avoid trying to 
present technical details of your work. Instead, you should provide the 
audience with a very high-level idea, ideally, presented in a catchy, 
entertaining manner.
To participate in the Minute of Madness send an email with your slide  
to <A HREF="https://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-linguistics">eswc2016pd at easychair.org</A> no later than May 29 (23:59 Hawaii time)  
(strict deadline). The subject of the email should be &quot;ESWC2016 Minute 
Madness&quot; and the email has to include the following details:
(1) your name (i.e., the person who presents the talk);
(2) a title for your talk -- if your talk is an advertisement for your 
demo or your poster, the title must be the title of the poster/demo and 
its submission number;
(3) a 1-page PDF document with the slide for your talk (The slide should 
be in a standard 4:3 format that is suitable for presenting on a 
projector with a resolution of 1024x768. Please ensure that your slide 
looks good in this format)

We will also aim to accommodate lightning proposals. However, if we run 
out of open spots, preference will be given to demo and poster 
advertisements, and remaining spots will be filled on a first-come 
first-served basis.
