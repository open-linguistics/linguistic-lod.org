***************************************************************************
The conference uses double-blind review by at least two reviewers, 
which means that both the reviewer and author identities are concealed 
from the reviewers, and vice versa, throughout the review process. 
To facilitate this, authors need to ensure that their manuscripts are 
prepared in a way that does not give away their identity.

All the registered papers will be submitted to IEEE for potential inclusion 
to IEEE Xplore as well as other Abstracting and Indexing (A&amp;I) databases. 
In addition, BEST registered papers will be published in one of the following 
special issues provided that the author do major improvements and extension 
within the time frame that will be set by the conference and his/her paper 
is approved by the chief editor:

* International Journal of New Computer Architectures and their Applications (IJNCAA)
* International Journal of Digital Information and Wireless Communications (IJDIWC)
* International Journal of Cyber-Security and Digital Forensics (IJCSDF)
