The annual SEMANTiCS conference is the meeting place for professionals 
who make semantic computing work, who understand its benefits and 
encounter its limitations. Every year, SEMANTiCS attracts information 
managers, IT-architects, software engineers and researchers from 
organisations ranging from NPOs, through public administrations to the 
largest companies in the world. Attendees learn from industry experts 
and top researchers about emerging trends and topics in the fields of 
semantic software, enterprise data, linked data &amp; open data strategies, 
methodologies in knowledge modelling and text &amp; data analytics. The 
SEMANTiCS community is highly diverse; attendees have responsibilities 
in interlinking areas like knowledge management, technical 
documentation, e-commerce, big data analytics, enterprise search, 
document management, business intelligence and enterprise vocabulary 
management.

The success of last year&#8217;s conference in Vienna with more than 280 
attendees from 22 countries proves that SEMANTiCS 2016 will continue a 
long tradition of bringing together colleagues from around the world. 
There will be presentations on industry implementations, use case 
prototypes, best practices, panels, papers and posters to discuss 
semantic systems in birds-of-a-feather sessions as well as informal 
settings. SEMANTICS addresses problems common among information 
managers, software engineers, IT-architects and various specialist 
departments working to develop, implement and/or evaluate semantic 
software systems.

The SEMANTiCS program is a rich mix of technical talks, panel 
discussions of important topics and presentations by people who make 
things work - just like you. In addition, attendees can network with 
experts in a variety of fields. These relationships provide great value 
to organisations as they encounter subtle technical issues in any stage 
of implementation. The expertise gained by SEMANTiCS attendees has a 
long-term impact on their careers and organisations. These factors make 
SEMANTiCS for our community the major industry related event across Europe.

SEMANTiCS 2016 will especially welcome submissions for the following hot 
topics:
* Data Quality Management
* Data Science (Data Mining, Machine Learning, Network Analytics)
* Semantics on the Web, Linked (Open) Data &amp; schema.org
* Corporate Knowledge Graphs
* Knowledge Integration and Language Technologies
* Economics of Data, Data Services and Data Ecosystems

Posters &amp; Demos Track
The Posters &amp; Demonstrations Track invites innovative work in progress, 
late-breaking research and innovation results, and smaller contributions 
in all fields related to the broadly understood Semantic Web. These 
include submissions on innovative applications with impact on end users 
such as demos of solutions that users may test or that are yet in the 
conceptual phase, but are worth discussing, and also applications or 
pieces of code that may attract developers and potential research or 
business partners. This also concerns new data sets made publicly available.

The informal setting of the Posters &amp; Demonstrations Track encourages 
participants to present innovations to the research community, business 
users and find new partners or clients and engage in discussions about 
the presented work. Such discussions can be invaluable inputs for the 
future work of the presenters, while offering conference participants an 
effective way to broaden their knowledge of the emerging research trends 
and to network with other researchers.

Poster and demo submissions should consist of a paper of 1-4 pages that 
describe the work, its contribution to the field or novelty aspects. 
Submissions must be original and must not have been submitted for 
publication elsewhere. All submissions should follow the ACM ICPS 
guidelines for formatting. The layout templates can be found here: 
<A HREF="http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates.">http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates.</A> The best 
posters (5-6 papers) will be published in the digital library of the ACM 
ICP Series. The other papers will be published in the 
<A HREF="http://ceur-ws.org/.">http://ceur-ws.org/.</A> Papers should be submitted through EasyChair 
(<A HREF="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=semantics2016research">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=semantics2016research</A>). Papers 
must be submitted in PDF (Adobe's Portable Document Format) format. 
Other formats will not be accepted. For the camera-ready version, the 
source files (Latex, Word) will also be needed.
Submissions will be reviewed by experienced and knowledgeable 
researchers and practitioners; each submission will receive a detailed 
feedback. For demos, it would be beneficial to include also links 
enabling the reviewers testing the application or reviewing the component.
