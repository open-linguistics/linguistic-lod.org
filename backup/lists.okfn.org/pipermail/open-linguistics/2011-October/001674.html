<PRE>Some of the digital video data from the British Sign Language (BSL) Corpus
project is now online (although not yet with translations and
annotations).

Those of you who understand BSL or another sign language or who might be
just curious, you can take a look at the open-access data here:
www.bslcorpusproject.org/data. This data includes (a) spontaneous personal
experience narratives and (b) responses to the lexical elicitation task
(the word list for which can be found here:
<A HREF="http://www.bslcorpusproject.org/cava/activities/">http://www.bslcorpusproject.org/cava/activities/</A>). There is also
conversational and interview data that are currently restricted access,
and for which you will need to register to download.

We hope to upload ELAN annotation files and English translations for much of the data in the future.

Regards,
Adam

Subject: Re: [open-linguistics] LLOD workshop at SLE 2012 - Who can provide a mini-abstract of their work?

Dear all
We are organizing the 10th Conference on Terminology and Knowledge Engineering to be held next June 2012, in Madrid, Spain. The CfP has not been issued yet. I'll let you know as soon as the webpage is finished. There will also be a call for workshops proposals. That'll be another nice scenario!!

Best wishes

Dear Open Data linguists,

one of my current goals is to establish Open Data as a topic at all major linguistics conferences. We will have a workshop at the next DGfS, which looks very promising. We will probably also be present at LREC. Another good venue to promote our ideas would be the SLE meeting (European equivalent of LSA), with 450 participants or so.

The application procedure is somewhat peculiar there: one can only apply for a workshop if one already knows that there are qualified people interested. This has to be proven with mini-abstracts. If the workshop is accepted, the participants have to submit normal abstracts, which undergo normal reviewing.

I would like such an Open Data workshop to take place at SLE 2012, but before I really start organizing it, I would like to know:

a) who would be interested in  presenting their work

b) who can contribute a 300 words abstract until the end of the month

Please get back to me asap because the deadlines are tough. If we get 6+ presenters, I will put together a description. The topic of the workshop will probably related to the DGfS workshop (<A HREF="http://ldl2012.lod2.eu/">http://ldl2012.lod2.eu/</A>), but I am open to suggestions

Please see the original CfP below

Best wishes

Sebastian

Guidelines for submission: workshop proposals and papers, posters and general session papers

PROCEDURE. The deadline for the submission of workshop proposals is 15 November 2011. The address for submission is <A HREF="https://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-linguistics">sle at arts.kuleuven.be</A>&lt;mailto:<A HREF="https://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-linguistics">sle at arts.kuleuven.be</A>&gt;. Notification of acceptance/rejection will be given by 15 December 2011. After a workshop proposal has been accepted, the convenors will be requested to invite their participants to submit their full abstracts by 15 January 2012. These full abstracts will be evaluated individually by the Scientific Committee and the convenors.

The deadline for all abstracts (for the general session, the poster session and the workshops) is 15 January 2012. Notification of acceptance will be given by 31 March 2011.

Abstracts should not exceed 500 words (exclusive of references) and should clearly state research questions, approach, method, data and (expected) results.

Abstracts should be registered and submitted via the Submit Abstract form&lt;<A HREF="http://wwwling.arts.kuleuven.be/conference/admin/SubmitAbstractSLE">http://wwwling.arts.kuleuven.be/conference/admin/SubmitAbstractSLE</A>&gt; where you can upload an attachment. The abstract should not mention the presenter(s) nor their affiliations or addresses. Abstracts are preferably in Word or .RTF format; if your abstract contains special symbols, please include a pdf version as well.

ORGANIZING A WORKSHOP. Whereas general session papers can deal with any topic in linguistics, workshop papers take into account the topic of the workshop proposal, and are usually pre-selected by the workshop convenors.

Workshop proposals should contain:

 *   A 1000 word description of the topic (including the research questions to be addressed) and
 *   a (provisional) list of workshop participants and 300 word abstracts of their papers.

We encourage workshop convenors to distribute an open call for papers on the LinguistList (announce your cfp as a session of SLE 2012) and other fora in October 2011.

Since we want conference participants to be able to attend individual workshop presentations, SLE workshops have to be compatible with the main conference schedule. This means that the format of the workshops must be organized around 30 minute presentations (20 min. + 10 min. discussion). Workshops can contain 10 or 15 slots (corresponding to 1 or 1.5 days); each workshop ideally comprises:

 1.  An introductory paper by the convenor(s) or by a key-note speaker, which summarizes previous research, specifies the approach(es) to be taken and sets the scope of the papers to be presented.
 2.  Eight papers (1 day) or thirteen papers (1.5 day).
 3.  A slot for final discussion on the topics covered by the papers, methodological issues and questions for future research.

Further details can be discussed with the SLE Conference Manager&lt;mailto:<A HREF="https://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-linguistics">sle at arts.kuleuven.be</A>&gt;.

POSTERS. The next SLE meeting will hold a poster session of an hour for both senior and junior researchers. In order to foster interaction, all other sessions will be suspended during the poster session. Posters may be remain available during the rest of the conference. The maximum size of the poster is 1.10 m (vertical) x 1 m (horizontal). For more information about how to make a good poster, click here&lt;<A HREF="http://people.eku.edu/ritchisong/posterpres.html">http://people.eku.edu/ritchisong/posterpres.html</A>&gt;.

MULTIPLE PAPERS. One person may submit a single-authored abstract, a single-authored abstract and a co-authored one (not as first author) or two co-authored abstracts (only one as first author). Note that keynote papers within workshops count as ordinary papers. Presentations will be 20 minutes plus 10 minutes question time.

EVALUATION. Workshop proposals contain the names of convenors and participants and will be evaluated and ranked by the 5 officers of the SLE Scientific Committee. All abstracts will be reviewed anonymously by three referees. Abstracts submitted to the general session and to the poster session will be evaluated by three members of the Scientific Committee. Workshop papers receive two evaluations by SC members and one by the workshop convenors. The threshold for acceptance is the same for general session, poster and workshop abstracts. The acceptance of a paper depends on the quality of the abstract. The acceptance rate of the previous conference was 68%.

Prize for the best presentation and the best poster

There will be a prize for the best oral presentation by a PhD student, a prize for the best oral presentation by a postdoc and a prize for the best poster.

For current purposes, PhD-students are students that have not completed their PhD before the conference. Postdocs have completed their PhD not earlier than January 2009. A nominated paper may be co-authored; in such a case the nominee will be the first author.

Applicants are invited to mark the button referring to the prize when they register their abstract. On the basis of the ranking of the abstracts, the Scientific Committee will set up an internal shortlist with nominees for the prizes.

Members of the Editorial Board of Folia Linguistica (Historica) and the Scientific Committee will decide who will be awarded the first prize in each category, which consists of 500 Euros, and the 2nd and 3rd prize, which is a three-year SLE membership&lt;<A HREF="http://www.societaslinguistica.eu/membership/join.php">http://www.societaslinguistica.eu/membership/join.php</A>&gt;.

Registration

Registration will start from 1 April 2012 onwards. From this year on, the SLE meeting will be a member only conference. That is, all participants with a paper in the program will have to be members. The early bird conference fee for members will be 170 Euros.

Become a member of the Societas Linguistica Europaea&lt;<A HREF="http://www.societaslinguistica.eu/membership/join.php">http://www.societaslinguistica.eu/membership/join.php</A>&gt;.

Social programme

There will be a reception in the City Hall of Stockholm (included in the registration fee) and a conference dinner. On Saturday afternoon there will be a post-conference excursion. Further information will be given in the second circular.

How to get to Stockholm

Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, is well connected by train, boat and airways. Stockholm is a key hub for flights in the Baltic Sea Region, the European Union and the rest of the world. It has three major airports - Arlanda (the primary gateway to Sweden), Bromma (smaller, but close to central Stockholm) and Skavsta (although 1,5 hours away by airport bus, this is the hub for Ryanair, Europe's largest low cost airline). Train tickets from continental Europe can be booked at <A HREF="http://www.sl.se,">http://www.sl.se,</A> and all major travel agencies should have information on boat schedules for the Baltic Sea Region.
