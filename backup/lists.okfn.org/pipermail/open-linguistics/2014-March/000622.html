** Deadline Extension:
**     Sunday 23 March 2014 - 23:59 Hawaii Time

11th Extended Semantic Web Conference (ESWC) 2014
Dates: May 25 - 29, 2014
Venue: Anissaras, Crete, Greece
Hashtag: #eswc2014
Feed: @eswc_conf
Site: <A HREF="http://2014.eswc-conferences.org">http://2014.eswc-conferences.org</A>
General Chair: Valentina Presutti (STLab, ISTC-CNR, IT)
Poster and Demo Chairs:
- Raphael Troncy (Multimedia Department, EURECOM, FR)
- Eva Blomqvist (Department of Computer and Information Science, Linkoping University, SE)

The demonstrations track of the ESWC 2014 complements the overall program of the conference with demonstrations of real-world, applied-and-tested advances of semantic technologies. In addition to papers and posters presenting latest theoretical achievements, the ESWC 2014 is seeking demonstrations of novel applications of semantics in various sectors, including: eGovernment,  eEnvironment, eMobility and smart cities, eHealth, Life Sciences, Sensor networks and RDF Stream Processing, Linked Science, Media and entertainment, Telecommunications, Cultural heritage, Financial services, Energy and utilities, Manufacturing, Digital libraries, Cloud applications, Personal Information Management, Decision support, Emergency and crisis management etc.

The demonstrations track is an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to present their innovative prototypes, practical developments, on-going projects, lessons learned and late-breaking results, relevant for the topics of interest of the main conference and the research and poster tracks.

Submissions to the demonstrations track should make clear what will be demonstrated, and in particular point out what makes the demonstration a novel showcase. A video of the demo should be provided if a link to the demonstrator is not available. Submission should also specify:

* What is the research background and application context of the demonstration, and what makes this a novel showcase for semantic technologies.
* What is the key technology used, and how does the demonstrated system, application or infrastructure relate to pre-existing work.
* What exactly will be demonstrated? What exactly will a visitor of the demonstration learn?

* Submission Guidelines *

Submissions to the demonstrations track must be in the form of a textual description of the demonstration to be given at the conference (which may include screenshots and must include either a link to the online demo or a video presenting it). The submissions must be at most 5 pages long including reference list (Springer LNCS style) and submitted as PDF. Decisions about acceptance will be based on relevance to the Semantic Web area, originality, potential significance, topicality and clarity. Papers that exceed the given page length or do not follow the LNCS guidelines will be rejected without a review.

Submissions should be uploaded using the Easychair system:
	<A HREF="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eswc2014pd">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eswc2014pd</A>

* Important Dates *

Submission Deadline: March 23, 2014 (23:59 Hawaii Time)
Notification of Acceptance: April 10, 2014
Camera-Ready Paper: April 25, 2014

* Important Notice *

Demonstrator papers will appear in supplementary post-conference proceedings to be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.

Participants with an accepted demo paper must register for the conference and present their system during the Demo Session. A space for demonstration will be allocated for each participant. Participants should use their own laptop for the demos. The organizers should be contacted well in advance of the conference in case of any special requirement.
