<PRE>DEADLINE EXTENDED: CALL FOR PAPERS OF RESEARCH &amp; IN-USE TRACKS

THE 6TH JOINT INTERNATIONAL SEMANTIC TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE (JIST 2016)

<A HREF="http://pat.scse.ntu.edu.sg/jist2016">http://pat.scse.ntu.edu.sg/jist2016</A>

November 2-4, 2016 (Wed-Fri) 

===============================
Recommendation to SCI Journals

The best (candidate) papers of JIST2016 will be invited to present at the Meet the Editor session of SCI indexed journals, including International Journal on Semantic Web and Information Systems (IJSWIS). More journals will be added soon.
===============================


The mission of the Joint International Semantic Technology Conference (JIST) is to bring together researchers in Semantic Technology research community and other areas of semantic related technologies to present their innovative research results or novel applications of semantic technologies.

The research track solicits submissions of original research work on semantic technologies and vocabularies. The in-use track solicits submissions of original work on applications of semantic technologies and vocabularies. Quality shared resources such as public ontologies, datasets and software are highly valuable to the research community, hence, JIST 2016 in-use track also calls for submissions of public, shared resources of interest to the Semantic Web community. 


* Topics of Interest 

Topics of interest can be found on the JIST2016 web site (research: <A HREF="http://pat.scse.ntu.edu.sg/jist2016/paper_rt.html,">http://pat.scse.ntu.edu.sg/jist2016/paper_rt.html,</A> in-use: <A HREF="http://pat.scse.ntu.edu.sg/jist2016/paper_iut.html">http://pat.scse.ntu.edu.sg/jist2016/paper_iut.html</A>). 


* Submission 

Submissions to JIST 2016 research &amp; in-use track should describe original, significant research on or innovative application of semantic technologies. Submissions to JIST 2016 are expected to present their claimed contribution, with clear evidence to support their claims. All submissions will be critically reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. To assess submissions, reviewers will judge their relevance to semantic technologies, their originality, the technical soundness of their proposed approach and the readability of the submission. JIST 2016 submissions are not anonymous. 

JIST 2016 will not accept submissions that are under review for or have already been published in or accepted for publication in a journal or another conference. Submissions must be in PDF format, using the style of the Springer Publications format for Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS). Submissions must be no longer than *16* pages for both tracks. Submissions that exceed this limit may be rejected without review. Submissions to the in-use track that are less than 16 pages can be considered. 

Accepted papers will be published in an LNCS proceedings. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the conference and present the paper at the conference. 

Papers are to be submitted electronically via <A HREF="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=jist2016.">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=jist2016.</A> Please select the appropriate track when you submit your paper(s).
