Important Dates
===============

Paper submission: 5 August 2016 23:59 Hawaii time
Notification: 5 September 2016 23:59 Hawaii time
Camera-ready due: 26 September 2016 23:59 Hawaii time
Workshop:  2 or 6 November 2016

===============
Scope and Topics
===============

Today&#8217;s digital media ecosystem generates massive streams of news, largely in the form of individual documents (&#8216;articles&#8217;) within which news events and narrative structures are communicated using natural language text. The increasing quantity of text documents produced by the ecosystem has presented challenges to those seeking to understand and contextualize news events and narratives over long periods of time, leading to demands for new multidimensional, multimodal and distributed representations of news events and of the narrative structures that are constructed from them. Currently, most work on cross-document temporal processing focuses on linear timelines (i.e. representations of chronologically ordered events), however not every timeline necessarily forms a good and useful storyline.

Following the success of 1st Workshop on Computing News Storylines (CNewsStory, ACL 2015), the 2nd edition of the Workshop on Computing News Storylines (CNewsStory, EMNLP 2016) aims at further exploring, investigating and understanding the cross-document connections between news events and stories.

This multidisciplinary workshop aims at gathering researchers in NLP, AI, knowledge representation and structured journalism together with journalists, policy makers and stakeholders in the news industry to discuss how NLP technology can help to deal with the current stream of information, manage the risks of information overload, identify different sources and perspectives, and provide unitary and easily intelligible representations of the larger and long-term storylines behind news articles.

We invite work on all aspects relating to the computational generation, representation, analysis or use of news storylines or their components, and on the relationships between news storylines or their components. This includes (but is not limited to) the following topics:


	&#8226; Identifying and filtering relevant events
	&#8226; Accumulating information from news streams
	&#8226; Detecting opinions and perspectives on events
	&#8226; Tracing perspective change through time
	&#8226; Modelling plot structures
	&#8226; Storyline stability and completeness
	&#8226; Annotating storylines
	&#8226; Crowdsourcing Storylines
	&#8226; Temporal or causal ordering of events
	&#8226; Script activation
	&#8226; Big data for storylines
	&#8226; Evaluation of storylines
	&#8226; Discourse structure and storylines
	&#8226; Visualisation of storylines
	&#8226; Visualisation of news clusters
	&#8226; Event factuality profiling
	&#8226; Multimodal storyline generation
	&#8226; Event-centred structured journalism
	&#8226; Event-centered natural language generation
	&#8226; Event taxonomies and ontologies
	&#8226; Characteristics of journalistic events and narratives
	&#8226; Representation of journalistic events and narratives
	&#8226; Narrative networks
	&#8226; Pattern detection in news
	&#8226; Advanced NLP news applications
	&#8226; Automatic Temporal Processing
	&#8226; Tools for automatic fact-checking on information extracted from corpora
	&#8226; News summarisation
	&#8226; Pattern detection in news reports
	&#8226; Trend prediction

=============
Submissions
=============

This call solicits full papers reporting original and unpublished research on storylines from news. Full papers should emphasize obtained results rather than intended work, and should indicate clearly the state of completion of the reported results. Submission should not exceed a maximum 8 pages plus two additional pages containing references.

Authors are also invited to submit short papers not exceeding 4 pages (plus two additional pages for references). Short papers should describe:

	&#8226; a small, focused contribution;
	&#8226; work in progress; 
	&#8226; a negative result;
	&#8226; a position paper.

The reviewing process will be double blind and papers should not include the authors' names and affiliations. Each submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. If you do include any author names on the title page, your submission will be automatically rejected. In the body of your submission, you should eliminate all direct references to your own previous work. Accepted papers will be published in the workshop proceedings and available at the ACL Anthology.

Multiple Submission Policy Papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or publications are acceptable, but authors must indicate this information at submission time. If accepted, authors must notify the organizers as to whether the paper will be presented at the workshop or elsewhere.

Submissions must be in PDF format and formatted following the official EMNLP 2016 submission styles

Contributions should be submitted in PDF via the submission site: <A HREF="https://www.softconf.com/emnlp2016/CNS/">https://www.softconf.com/emnlp2016/CNS/</A>
