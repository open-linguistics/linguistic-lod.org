CALL FOR RESEARCH, IN-USE AND POSITION PAPERS

20th International Conference on Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge
Management (EKAW 2016)

19-23 November 2016, Bologna, Italy
Abstract submission: July 8th, 2016
Paper submission: July 17th, 2016

Web site: <A HREF="http://ekaw2016.cs.unibo.it/?q=callforpapers">http://ekaw2016.cs.unibo.it/?q=callforpapers</A>
========================================================


The 20th International Conference on Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge
Management is concerned with the impact of time and space on the
representation of knowledge. Knowledge engineering has mostly been about
creating static, universal representations. Yet the world is rarely static:
everything changes, including the models, and real world systems need to
evolve along with the surrounding world. Also, what makes some
representations valid in some contexts may make them invalid elsewhere
(e.g., jurisdiction for laws).

The special focus of this year's EKAW is &quot;evolving knowledge&quot;, which
concerns all aspects of the management and acquisition of knowledge
representations of evolving, contextual, and local models. This includes
change management, trend detection, model evolution, streaming data and
stream reasoning, event processing, time-and space dependent models,
contextual and local knowledge representations, etc.

EKAW 2016 will put a special emphasis on the evolvability and localization
of knowledge and the correct usage of these limits.


== PROCEEDINGS ==

The proceedings of the research and in-use track will be published by
Springer Verlag in the LNCS series.
The authors of selected best papers will be invited to submit an extended
version of their manuscript to a special issue of the Semantic Web Journal
by IOS Press.


== BEST PAPER AWARD ==

Research and in-use papers are eligible for the Bob Wielinga Best Paper
Award (<A HREF="http://ekaw2016.cs.unibo.it/?q=awards">http://ekaw2016.cs.unibo.it/?q=awards</A>) sponsored by Springer Nature
that will award a prize of 1,000 euros to the best paper of the main track.


== TOPICS OF INTEREST ==

EKAW 2016 welcomes papers dealing with theoretical, methodological,
experimental, and application-oriented aspects of knowledge engineering and
knowledge management.
In particular, but not exclusively, we solicit papers about methods, tools
and methodologies relevant with regard to the following topics:

    - Knowledge in evolving and local contexts
        - Model evolution
            - Ontology evolution
            - Ontology debugging
            - Ontology change management and versioning

== TYPE OF PAPERS ==

We will accept different types of papers. The papers will all have the same
status and follow the same formatting guidelines in the proceedings but
will receive special treatment during the reviewing phase. In particular,
each paper type will be subject to its own evaluation criteria. The
Programme Committee will also make sure that there is a reasonable balance
of the paper types accepted. At submission time the paper has to be clearly
identified as belonging to one of the following categories.

    - Research papers: These are &quot;standard&quot; papers presenting a novel
method, technique or analysis with appropriate empirical or other types of
evaluation as a proof-of concept. The main evaluation criteria here will be
originality, technical soundness and validation.
    - In-use papers: Here we are expecting papers describing applications
of knowledge management and engineering in real environments. Applications
need to address a sufficiently interesting and challenging problem on
real-world datasets, involving many users etc. The focus is less on the
originality of the approach and more on presenting systems that solve a
significant problem while addressing the particular challenges that come
with the use of real-world data. Evaluations are essential for this type of
paper and should involve a representative subset of the actual users of the
system.
    - Position papers: We invite researchers to also publish position
papers, which describe novel and innovative ideas. Position papers may also
comprise an analysis of currently unsolved problems, or review these
problems from a new perspective, in order contribute to a better
understanding of these problems in the research community. We expect that
such papers will guide future research by highlighting critical
assumptions, motivating the difficulty of a certain problem or explaining
why current techniques are not sufficient, possibly corroborated by
quantitative and qualitative arguments.
