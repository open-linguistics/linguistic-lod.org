First Call for Papers

3rd Workshop on LINKED DATA IN LINGUISTICS (LDL-2014): Multilingual  
Knowledge Resources and Natural Language Processing

Tuesday, May 27, 2014, Reykjavik (Iceland)

Collocated with the 9th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference
(LREC-2014)

<A HREF="http://ldl2014.org/">http://ldl2014.org/</A>

================================================================================


The explosion of information technology has led to a substantial
growth in quantity, diversity and complexity of linguistic data
accessible on the Web. The lack of interoperability between linguistic
and language resources represents a major challenge that needs to be
addressed, in particular, if information from different sources is to
be combined, such as machine-readable lexicons, corpus data and
terminology repositories. The Linked Data in Linguistics (LDL)
workshop series provides a forum to discuss these types of resources,
strategies to address issues of interoperability between them,
protocols to distribute, access and integrate this information and
technologies and infrastructures developed on this basis.

The goal of the workshop is twofold. First, we will assemble
researchers from various fields of linguistics, natural language
processing, knowledge management and information technology to present
and discuss principles, case studies, and best practices for
representing, publishing and linking mono- and multilingual
linguistic and knowledge data collections, including corpora,
grammars, dictionaries, wordnets, translation memories, domain
specific ontologies etc. In this sense, we particularly invite
contributions discussing the application of the Linked Open Data
paradigm to linguistic data as it might provide an important step
towards making linguistic data:
i) easily and uniformly queryable,
ii) interoperable and
iii) sharable over the Web using open standards such as the HTTP
protocol and the RDF data model [1].

The adaptation of some processes and best practices to multilingual
linguistic resources and knowledge bases acquires also new relevance
in this context. Some processes may need to be modified to accommodate
the publication of resources that contain information in several
languages. Also the linking process between linguistic resources in
different languages poses important research questions, as well as the
development and application of freely available knowledge bases and
crowdsourcing to compensate the lack of publicly accessible language
resources for various languages.

Secondly, we will provide researchers on natural language processing
and semantic web technologies a platform to present case studies and
best practices on the exploitation of linguistic resources exposed on
the Web for Natural Language Processing applications, or other
content-centered applications such as content analytics, knowledge
extraction, etc. The availability of massive linked open knowledge
resources raises the question how such data can be suitably employed
to facilitate different NLP tasks and research questions. Following
the tradition of earlier LDL workshops, we encourage contributions to
the Linguistic Linked Open Data (LLOD) cloud [2] and research on this
basis. In particular, this pertains to contributions that demonstrate
an added value resulting from the combination of linked datasets and
ontologies as a source for semantic information with linguistic
resources published according to as linked data principles. Another
important question to be addressed in the workshop is how Natural
Language Processing techniques can be employed to further facilitate
the growth and enrichment of linguistic resources on the Web.

The intended audience includes linguists, NLP engineers and
researchers from any field of computer science interested in the
application of Semantic Web formalisms and related technologies to
language data, empirically-working linguists and lexicographers
interested in the representation, exchange and interlinking of
knowledge resources, linguistic data and metadata, and developers of
infrastructures for linguistic data and other researchers with an
interest in both aspects.

Background and History
=========================
This workshop brings together two community efforts, the Open
Linguistics Working Group of the Open Knowledge Foundation (OWLG), and
the W3C Ontology-Lexica Community Group. LDL-2014 is also supported by
a recently started EU Support Action: LIDER (Linked Data as an enabler
of cross-media and multilingual content analytics for enterprises
across Europe), which aims to provide an ecosystem for the
establishment of linguistic linked open data, as well as media
resources metadata, for a free and open exploitation of such resources
in multilingual, cross-media content analytics across Europe.

The workshop is continuing a series of workshops on the application of
the Linked Data paradigm to linguistic data that have been initiated
and organized by the Open Linguistics Working Group: The First
Workshop on Linked Data in Linguistics (LDL-2012) was conducted in
March 2012 at the University of Frankfurt am Main/Germany, and
collocated with the 34th Annual Meeting of the German Linguistics
Society (DGfS-2012). The Workshop on Multilingual Linked Open Data for
Enterprises (MLODE-2012) was conducted in September 2012 at the
University of Leipzig/Germany, and collocated with the 3rd Conference
on Software Agents and Services for Business, Research and E-Science
(SABRE-2012). The Second Workshop on Linked Data in Linguistics
(LDL-2013) was conducted in Sep 2013 at CNR in Pisa/Italy, and
collocated with the 6th International Conference on the Generative
Lexicon (GL2013).


Linguistic Linked Data Challenge
==================================
There is a data challenge associated to the Linguistic Linked Data
Workshop. In addition to regular workshop papers, we will accept
dataset description of 4-6 pages describing new linguistic dataset
published on the web as linked data. These linguistic datasets
include, but are not limited to, lexica, terminologies, semantic
networks, annotated and parallel corpora, multimodal resources,
typological databases and linguistic metadata. The data challenge
committee will review and evaluate data according to four dimensions,
with prizes of up to -700, funded by the LIDER project, awarded to the
highest scoring datasets.
The criteria for the Linguistic Linked Data Challenge include:

- Availability
     - Use of Linked Data and RDF.
     - Hosted on a publicly accessible server and be available both
during the    period of the evaluation and beyond.
     - Use of an open license.
- Quality of Resource
     - Represents useful linguistic information.
     - Reuses relevant standards and models.
     - Contains multiple levels of annotation.
- Linking
     - Links to external resources.
     - Reuse of existing properties and categories.
- Impact/usefulness of the resource
     - Relevant and likely to be reused by many researchers in NLP and
wider fields.
     - Uses linked data to improve the quality of and access to the  
resource.

Details of the challenge will be announced in a separate call for
contributions, see <A HREF="http://ldl2014.org/challenge.html">http://ldl2014.org/challenge.html</A> for up-to-date
information.


Topics of interest
=====================
We invite contributions related (but not limited) to the following topics:

1. Use cases and project proposals for the creation, publication or
application of linguistic data collections that are linked with other
resources

2. Modelling linguistic data and metadata with OWL and/or RDF

3. Ontologies for linguistic data and metadata collections as well as  
cross-
lingual retrieval

4. Descriptions of data sets following Linked Data principles

5. Applications of such data, other ontologies or linked data from any
subdiscipline of linguistics (may include work in progress or project
descriptions)

6. Application and applicability of (Linguistic) Linked Open Data in NLP

7. NLP contributions to (Linguistic) Linked Open Data

8. Challenges of multilinguality and the use of LOD and
collaboratively constructed open resources for knowledge extraction,
machine translation and other NLP tasks.

9. Legal and social aspects of Linguistic Linked Open Data

10. Best practices for the publication and linking of multilingual
knowledge resources

Submission &amp; Publication
==========================
We accept submission of both long (up to 8 pages) and short papers (up
to 4 pages) to be presented as long or short oral presentation at the
workshop. The papers of the workshop will be published as online
proceedings. In addition, we aim for a journal special issue as
post-conference proceedings in which a selected amount of papers
presented at the workshop will be published.
When submitting a paper from the START page, authors will be asked to
provide essential information about resources (in a broad sense, i.e.
also technologies, standards, evaluation kits, etc.) that have been
used for the work described in the paper or are a new result of your
research. Moreover, ELRA encourages all LREC authors to share the
described LRs (data, tools, services, etc.), to enable their reuse,
replicability of experiments, including evaluation ones, etc. If this
data (or parts of it) are provided as Linked Data, then please also
consider to participate in the Linguistic Linked Data Challenge
(<A HREF="http://ldl2014.org/challenge.html">http://ldl2014.org/challenge.html</A>).
