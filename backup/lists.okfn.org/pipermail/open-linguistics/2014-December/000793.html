TENURE TRACK POSITION IN DIGITAL HUMANITIES
UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA


The College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Virginia invites 
applications for a tenure-track position at the rank of Assistant 
Professor in digital humanities (DH), with a focus on textual analysis 
or big history. Applicants should have a Ph.D. at the time of 
appointment, and should have a record of interdisciplinary research in 
computer-assisted analysis of large corpora, archival documents, or 
other materials. Candidates should demonstrate competencies in one or 
more of the following: visualization, network analysis, software 
development, bibliometrics, and quantitative approaches to evidence, 
text processing, computational linguistics, natural language processing, 
or computer-assisted reading. We will consider applications from 
scholars investigating any historical period or cultural context, genre, 
theory, or method within humanities.

A specialist in DH who is trained in large-scale analysis would 
complement Virginia's traditions of excellence and innovation in DH. The 
appointed scholar will foster interdisciplinary collaboration, pedagogy, 
and public access to research in DH. Opportunities for affiliation 
include the long-standing Institute for Advanced Technology in the 
Humanities and Scholars' Lab, within the University of Virginia Library, 
and initiatives including the Data Science Institute, the Center for the 
Study of Data &amp; Knowledge, and the University of Virginia Advanced 
Computing Services &amp; Engagement. UVA's excellence in textual studies, 
bibliography and the history of book as well as diverse programs in 
literatures and languages will enrich this professor's opportunities, 
yet potential home departments also include Media Studies, Anthropology, 
Art History, Drama, Music, Classics, Philosophy, History, and Religious 
Studies. With possible affiliation in programs such as Linguistics, 
Woodson Institute for African-American and African Studies, South Asia 
Center, East Asia Center, Women and Gender Studies, or American Studies, 
the appointment nevertheless is tenure-track within a department of Arts 
and Sciences rather than a center, institute, library, or program.

This position is one of several interdisciplinary lines sponsored by the 
Mellon Foundation. The successful candidate will participate in 
activities of the Mellon-funded Institute of Humanities and Global 
Cultures, including one team-taught course in the first two years. The 
teaching load is two courses each, in fall and spring semesters. 
Teaching experience at the undergraduate and/or graduate level is preferred.

To apply, submit a Candidate Profile through <A HREF="https://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-linguistics">Jobs at UVa</A> 
(<A HREF="https://jobs.virginia.edu">https://jobs.virginia.edu</A>), search on posting number 0615478 and 
electronically attach the following: CV; cover letter that includes a 
description of your research in the field; the names and contact 
information for three references; a statement of teaching philosophy; 
and a link to an Online Portfolio that includes examples and 
descriptions of digital work and/or research.
Additional materials will be requested of those candidates selected for 
interviews.

The review of applications will begin on January 15, 2015. The 
appointment will begin August 25, 2015. Questions regarding the 
application process should be directed to: June Webb, 434-924-6608. 
Direct questions about this position to Alison Booth, Search Committee 
Chair, <A HREF="https://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-linguistics">Dig-hum at virginia.edu.</A>
