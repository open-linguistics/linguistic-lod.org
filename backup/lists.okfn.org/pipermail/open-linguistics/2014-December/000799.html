# DESCRIPTION

The main goal of the SAVE-SD workshop is to bring together publishers, companies and researchers from different fields (among which Document and Knowledge Engineering, Semantic Web, Natural Language Processing, Scholarly Communication, Bibliometrics, and Human-Computer Interaction) in order to bridge the gap between the theoretical/academic and practical/industrial aspects in regards to scholarly data.

The following fields will be addressed:
- semantics of scholarly data, i.e. how to semantically represent, categorise, connect and integrate scholarly data, in order to foster reusability and knowledge sharing;
- analytics on scholarly data, i.e. designing and implementing novel and scalable algorithms for knowledge extraction with the aim of understanding research dynamics, forecasting research trends, fostering connections between groups of researchers, informing research policies, analysing and interlinking experiments and deriving new knowledge;
- visualisation of and interaction with scholarly data, i.e. providing novel user interfaces and applications for navigating and making sense of scholarly data and highlighting their patterns and peculiarities.


# TOPICS OF INTEREST

We would encourage submission of papers covering one or more of the following topics:

Semantics:
- Data models (e.g., ontologies, vocabularies, schemas) for the description of scholarly data and the linking between scholarly data and academic papers that report or cite them
- Description of citations and citation networks
- Theoretical models describing the rhetorical and argumentative structure of scholarly papers and
their application in practice
- Description and use of provenance information of scholarly data
- From digital libraries of scholarly papers to Linked Open Datasets: models, applicability and
challenges
- Definition and description of scholarly publishing processes
- Modelling licences for scholarly documents and data

Analytics:
- Assessing the quality and/or trust of scholarly data
- Pattern discovery of scholarly data
- Citation analysis and prediction
- Scientific claims identification from textual contents
- New indicators for measuring the quality and relevance of research
- Comparison between standard metrics (e.g., h-index, impact factor, citation counting) and
alternative metrics in real-case scenarios
- Automatic or semi-automatic approaches to making sense of research dynamics
- Content- and data-based semantic similarity of scholarly papers
- Citation generation
- Automatic semantic enhancement of existing scholarly libraries and papers
- Reconstruction, forecasting and monitoring of scholarly data

Visualisation and Interaction:
- Novel user interfaces for interaction with paper, metadata, content, and data
- Visualisation of citation networks according to multiple dimensions (e.g., citation counting,
citation functions, kinds of citing/cited entities)
- Visualisation of related papers or data according to multiple dimensions (semantic similarity of
abstracts, keywords, etc.)
- Applications for making sense of scholarly data
- Usability studies on existing interfaces (e.g., Web sites, Web applications, smartphone apps) for
browsing scholarly data
- Scholarly data and ubiquity: accessing scholarly information from multiple devices (PC, tablet,
smartphones)
- Applications for the (semi-)automatic annotation of scholarly papers


# IMPORTANT DATES

- Submission deadline: January 24, 2015 (23:59 Hawaii Standard Time)
- Acceptance notification: February 22, 2015
- Camera ready deadline: March 8, 2015


# SUBMISSIONS

SAVE-SD welcomes the submission of original research and application papers dealing with the tree aforementioned field. We encourage theoretical, methodological, empirical and applications papers. We appreciate the submission of papers incorporating links to data sets and other material used for evaluation as well as to live demos and software source code.

All submissions must be written in English. Two formats are possible for the submission:
- PDF, a file formatted according to the ACM double-column instructions (<A HREF="http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates">http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates</A>);
- HTML, a zip archive containing an HTML file compliant with the Research Articles in Simplified HTML (RASH) format (<A HREF="http://cs.unibo.it/save-sd/rash/index.html">http://cs.unibo.it/save-sd/rash/index.html</A>).

We invite four kinds of submissions:
- full research papers (max. 6 pp. in PDF or 5400 words in HTML)
- position papers (max. 4 pp. in PDF or 3600 words in HTML) 
- demo papers (max. 2 pp. in PDF or 1800 words in HTML)   
- poster papers (max. 2 pp. in PDF or 1800  words in HTML) 

All the aforementioned limits include metadata (title, authors, keywords, ACM categories, abstract), acknowledgements, references and the whole content of the paper. In the HTML format, figures and tables count 300 words each.

Submissions and reviewing will be supported by the EasyChair system:
<A HREF="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=savesd2015">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=savesd2015</A>


# EVALUATION OF SUBMISSIONS

In order to evaluate the submitted papers, we have three different program committees:
- The Senior PC, whose members will act as meta-reviewers and have the crucial role of balancing the scores provided by the reviews from the other two PCs (see below);
- The Industrial PC, who will evaluate the submissions from an industrial perspective mainly &#226;&#128;&#147; by assessing how much the theories/applications described in the papers do/may influence (positively or negatively) the publishing domain and whether they could be concretely adopted by publishers and scholarly data providers;
- The Academic PC, who will evaluate the papers from an academic perspective mainly &#226;&#128;&#147; by assessing the quality of the research described in such papers.

All submissions will be reviewed by (at least) one Senior PC member, one Industrial PC member and two Academic PC members. The final decision of acceptance/rejection will be made in consensus by the chairs.


# PUBLICATION VENUES

The proceedings of SAVE-SD will be collected in the Companion volume of the WWW 2015 conference, which will be published by ACM in its digital library. The WWW 2015 organisers will require at least one registration per paper published in the Companion volume. At the time of submission of the final camera-ready copy, authors will have to indicate the already registered person for that publication.

In addition, the authors of the best papers of the workshop will be invited to submit an extended version of their work to a special issue that will be published as part of the Journal of Documentation (<A HREF="http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journal/jd">http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journal/jd</A>), one of the longest established academic journals in library and information science (2013 Impact Factor: 1.035; indexed in several citation services, among which Elsevier's Scopus and Thomson Reuters' Journal Citation Reports).


# INVITED SPEAKER

The invited speaker for the opening keynote of the workshop will be Paul Groth from Elsevier Labs.

Paul Groth holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Southampton (2007), has done research at the University of Southern California, and has been an assistant professor in the Web and Media Group at the VU University of Amsterdam and a member of its Network Institute. 

His research focuses on dealing with large amounts of diverse contextualised knowledge with a particular focus on the web and science applications. This includes research in data provenance, web and data science, knowledge and data integration and knowledge sharing. Paul was co-chair of the W3C Provenance Working Group that created a standard for provenance interchange. He is co-author of Provenance: an Introduction to PROV. Currently, he is a key contributor to Open PHACTS (<A HREF="http://www.openphacts.org">http://www.openphacts.org</A>) - a project to develop a provenance-enabled platform for large scale pharmacological information. He blogs at <A HREF="http://thinklinks.wordpress.com.">http://thinklinks.wordpress.com.</A> You can find him on twitter: @pgroth


# AWARDS

An award of 250 euros, kindly sponsored by Pensoft (<A HREF="http://www.pensoft.net">http://www.pensoft.net</A>), will be assigned to the best paper of the workshop. The decision will be taken by considering both the reviews received and how the authors will address the reviewers' concerns in the camera ready.

Another award of 150 euros as a voucher for buying Springer's products, kindly sponsored by Springer (<A HREF="http://www.springer.com">http://www.springer.com</A>), will be assigned to the best workshop submission in RASH format (i.e., simplified HTML+RDFa). The decision will be taken by considering the quality of the markup (i.e., the less syntactical mistakes there are in the markup, the better), the number of RDF statements defined in RDFa, and the number of RDF links to LOD datasets.
