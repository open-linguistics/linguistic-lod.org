<PRE>
Fifth International Conference on the Future Generation Communication  
Technologies (FGCT 2016)
Luton, (near London). UK
August 17-19, 2016
www.socio.org.uk/fgct

In the last decade, a number of newer communication technologies have  
been evolved, which have a significant impact on the technology, as a  
whole. The impact ranges from incremental applications to dramatical  
breakthrough in the society. Users rely heavily on broadcast  
technology, social media, mobile devices, video games and other  
innovations to enrich the learning and adoption process.

This conference is designed for teachers, administrators,  
practitioners, researchers and scientists in the development arenas.  
It aims to provide discussions and simulations in the communication  
technology at the broad level and broadcasting technology and related  
technologies at the micro level. Through a set of research papers,  
using innovative and interactive approach, participants can expect to  
share a set of research that will prepare them to apply new  
technologies to their work in teaching, research and educational  
development amid this rapidly evolving landscape.
