<PRE>##SELECTION_END##Dear openers!

I would like to share with you the call for proposals for the next
International Open Data Conference to be held in Madrid (Spain) next
October 6-7, I do hope you to join the conference.

<A HREF="http://opendatacon.org&#160;">http://opendatacon.org&#160;</A>
<A HREF="http://opendatacon.org/iodc16/call-for-proposals/">http://opendatacon.org/iodc16/call-for-proposals/</A>

All the open data community is invited to contribute to the agenda and
develop the outcomes of the 4th International Open Data Conference
(IODC). Furthermore, linguistics have a great opportunity to share our
work, experience or insights with other data communities.

IODC 2106 will be built on the successful experience of IODC 2015 and
will take into consideration the results of many other relevant open
data events, leveraging the momentum of the existing collaborations of
the growing open data community, to release and expand the potential of
open data.

They are opening three forms of contribution that will help us shape
the conference agenda and its results:

- Call for Impact: inspiring open-data-driven initiatives
- Call for Sharing: collaborative learning, skills, and good practices
- Call for Action: building a roadmap for the global open data
community

You may submit more than one proposal, but each submission must be made
separately. Submissions must be received no later than April 3rd, 2016.

The working language of IODC 2016 will be English; thus, proposals and
presentations are only accepted in English. Should your proposal be
accepted, please note that presentations must be completed in person
and in English; thus, translators and video recordings or direct call
videos are not permitted.

The contributions received during the Call for Proposals will be
reviewed by members of the Programme Committee. The members of the
Programme Committee are key experts, representing relevant institutions
with experience working in different Open Data fields. They will
contribute generously with their time to help building the best
possible agenda for the Open Data community.

Please note that all participants (attendees and participants) in IODC
2016 must agree to the terms and conditions of the IODC Code of
Conduct.

Looking forward to hearing from you

All the Best!
