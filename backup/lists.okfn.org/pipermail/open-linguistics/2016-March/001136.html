==================================================================
ESWC 2016 Call For Demonstration Papers
May 29th - June 2nd, 2016
Anissaras, Crete, Greece
<A HREF="http://2016.eswc-conferences.org/call-demos">http://2016.eswc-conferences.org/call-demos</A>
==================================================================


The Demonstrations Track of the ESWC 2016 complements the overall 
program of the conference with demos of real-world, applied-and-tested 
advances of semantic technologies. In addition to papers and posters 
presenting latest theoretical achievements, ESWC 2016 is seeking 
demonstrations of novel applications of semantics in various sectors, 
including: Urban Life and Mobility, eHealth, eGovernment, eEnvironment, 
Life Sciences, Sensor networks and RDF Stream Processing, Linked 
Science, Media and entertainment, Telecommunications, Cultural heritage, 
Financial services, Energy and utilities, Manufacturing, Digital 
libraries, Cloud applications, Personal Information Management, Decision 
support, Emergency and crisis management covering also inter-sectorial 
aspects of Cognitive Computing, Data Semantics, and Natural Language 
Processing.

The Demonstrations Track is an opportunity for researchers and 
practitioners to present their innovative prototypes, practical 
developments, on-going projects, lessons learned and late-breaking 
results, relevant for the topics of interest of the main conference and 
the research and poster tracks.

Submissions to the demonstrations track should make clear what will be 
demonstrated, and in particular point out what makes the demonstration a 
novel showcase. A video of the demo should be provided if a link to the 
demonstrator is not available. The submission should also specify:
* What is the research background and application context of the 
demonstration, and what makes this a novel showcase for semantic 
technologies.
* What is the key technology used, and how does the demonstrated system, 
application or infrastructure relate to pre-existing work.
* What exactly will be demonstrated? What exactly will a visitor of the 
demonstration learn?

Prize and minute madness
Accepted demo will be included into the &#8220;minute madness&#8221; pitch 
introducing the poster and demo session during the conference. They will 
also be enrolled into the competition for the best demo of ESWC 2016. 
More information about the &#8220;minute madness&#8221; material and program will be 
provided to the authors of accepted submissions.

Submission Guidelines
Submissions to the demonstrations track must be in the form of a textual 
description of the demonstration to be given at the conference (which 
may include screenshots and must include either a link to the online 
demo or a video presenting it). The submissions must be at most 5-page 
long including references (Springer LNCS style, 
<A HREF="https://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0">https://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0</A>) and 
submitted as PDF. Decisions about acceptance will be based on relevance 
to the Semantic Web area, originality, potential significance, 
topicality and clarity. Papers that exceed the given page length or do 
not follow the LNCS guidelines will be rejected without a review. 
Submissions must be uploaded on Easychair selecting the ESWC 2016 Demos 
Track at <A HREF="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eswc2016pd">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eswc2016pd</A> .

Important Dates
Submission Deadline: March 10, 2016
Notification of Acceptance: April 4, 2016
Camera-Ready Paper: April 18, 2016

All deadlines are intended to be 23:59 HST (Hawaii Time).

Important Notice
Demo papers will appear in supplementary post-conference proceedings to 
be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science 
series. Participants with an accepted demo paper must register for the 
conference and present their system during the Demo Session. A space for 
demonstration will be allocated for each participant. Participants 
should use their own laptop for the demos. The organizers should be 
contacted well in advance of the conference in case of any special 
requirement.
