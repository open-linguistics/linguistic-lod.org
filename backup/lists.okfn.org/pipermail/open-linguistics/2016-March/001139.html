========================================================

OVERVIEW

The 13th ESWC, to be held from May 29th to June 2nd in Heraklion, Crete, 
features no less than seven challenges this year!

The purpose of the challenges is to showcase the maturity of state of 
the art methods and tools on tasks common to the Semantic Web community 
and adjacent disciplines, in a controlled setting involving rigorous 
evaluation.

Semantic Web Challenges are an official track of the conference, 
ensuring significant visibility for the challenges as well as 
participants. Challenge participants are asked to present their 
submissions as well as provide a paper describing their work. The 
details of the submissions may vary per challenge and will be found in 
the individual calls. These papers must undergo a peer-review by experts 
relevant to the challenge task, and will be published in the official 
ESWC2016 Satellite Events proceedings.



IMPORTANT DATES

Individual challenges may deviate from these dates but as a rule the 
following dates apply:
* Training data ready and challenges Calls for Papers sent: Friday 
January 15th, 2016
* Challenge papers submission deadline: Monday March 21st, 2016
* Challenge paper reviews due: Tuesday April 5th, 2016
* Notifications sent to participants and invitations to submit task 
results: Friday April 8th, 2016
* Camera ready papers due: Sunday April 24th, 2016&#8203;


CHALLENGES AT A GLANCE

Open Knowledge Extraction (OKE) Challenge
The OKE challenge, launched as first edition at last year Extended 
Semantic Web Conference, ESWC2015, has the ambition to provide a 
reference framework for researc on Knowledge Extraction from text for 
the Semantic Web by re-defining a number of tasks (typically from 
information and knowledge extraction), taking into account specific SW 
requirements.
<A HREF="http://2016.eswc-conferences.org/eswc-16-open-knowledge-extraction-oke-challenge">http://2016.eswc-conferences.org/eswc-16-open-knowledge-extraction-oke-challenge</A>

Challenge on Semantic Sentiment Analysis
Social media evolution has given users one important opportunity for 
expressing their thoughts and opinions online. The information thus 
produced is related to many different areas such as commerce, tourism, 
education, health and causes the size of the Social Web to expand 
exponentially.
<A HREF="http://2016.eswc-conferences.org/eswc-16-challenge-semantic-sentiment-analysis">http://2016.eswc-conferences.org/eswc-16-challenge-semantic-sentiment-analysis</A>

Conference Live app Challenge
In the past two years the Extended Semantic Web Conference (ESWC) has 
provided a semantic Web application to browse conference data. The 
application, called Conference Live, is a Web and mobile application 
based on conference data from the Semantic Web Dog Food server, which 
provides facilities to browse papers and authors at a specific conference.
<A HREF="http://2016.eswc-conferences.org/eswc-16-conference-live-app-challenge">http://2016.eswc-conferences.org/eswc-16-conference-live-app-challenge</A>

6th Open Challenge on Question Answering over Linked Data (QALD-6)
The past years have seen a growing amount of research on question 
answering over Semantic Web data, shaping an interaction paradigm that 
allows end users to profit from the expressive power of Semantic Web 
standards while at the same time hiding their complexity behind an 
intuitive and easy-to-use interface. The Question Answering over Linked 
Data challenge provides an up-to-date benchmark for assessing and 
comparing systems that mediate between a user, expressing his or her 
information need in natural language, and RDF data.

Top-K Shortest Path in Large Typed RDF Graphs Challenge
The advent of SPARQL 1.1 introduced property paths as a new graph 
matching paradigm that allows the employment of Kleene star * (and it's 
variant +) unary operators to build SPARQL queries that are agnostic of 
the underlying RDF graph structure. The ability to express path patterns 
that are agnostic of the underlying graph structure is certainly a step 
forward.

Semantic Publishing Challenge 2016 &#8211; Assessing the Quality of Scientific 
Output in its Ecosystem
This is the next iteration of the successful Semantic Publishing 
Challenge of ESWC 2014 and 2015. We continue pursuing the objective of 
assessing the quality of scientific output, evolving thedataset 
bootstrapped in 2014 and 2015 to take into account the wider ecosystem 
of publications.
<A HREF="http://2016.eswc-conferences.org/assessing-quality-scientific-output-its-ecosystem">http://2016.eswc-conferences.org/assessing-quality-scientific-output-its-ecosystem</A>

schema.org - Bonus Challenge
Rather than create a separate schema.org challenge, we encourage where 
appropriate submissions to other ESWC2016 challenges to consider also 
exploring schema.org's relationship with Linked Data and Semantic Web 
tools, technologies, vocabularies and datasets.

Wikidata - Bonus Challenge
Wikidata is the largest free and open general purpose knowledge base in 
the world, collecting a wide variety of common and specialized knowledge 
in a machine-readable form. Wikimedia projects like Wikipedia make use 
of the data to enrich their articles. Anyone else is equally welcome to 
use the data in Wikidata to enrich their applications or do research, 
for example.
Over the past 3 years, Wikidata has grown rapidly and build a great 
community around structured knowledge.
The purpose of this additional challenge is to explore ways of closing 
key gaps in Wikidata or between Wikidata and the Linked Data and 
Semantic Web community.
First we offer a brief background on Wikidata and its current key gaps, 
then we outline how this relates to this year's set challenges.
