<PRE>Dear all,
instead of minutes for the telco, I would like to post the draft of the 
KEKI workshop proposal, because this was the main thing we discussed.
We are going to have another telco with just the chairs. If you wish to 
get involved, please tell us, so we can invite you to listen in,

all the best,
Sebastian

  The K&#201;KI Workshop 2016

*es of Linguistic Linked Open Data*

Proposal for a Full-Day Workshop at ISWC 2016


Sebastian Hellmann, Key-Sun Choi, John McCrae

Other involved people: Ciro Baron,  Christian Chiarcos, *?Seiji Koide?, 
  ?Jorge Gracia?,? Hideaki Takeda?*


Knowledge Integration (KI):

Ontologies, Identifiers and Data with respect to fusion of data

Knowledge Extraction (KE):

Lexica, Corpora and Knowledge Extraction in general


      Abstract

What kind of smart applications can we build, if we were able to 
integrate all available knowledge, data and language resources in a 
meaningful way? While Turing's imitation game is exciting, we are 
focu*s*sing on the actual knowledge engineering to build information 
machines that enable humans to perform more efficiently in their tasks. 
To achieve this goal, we believe the following two prerequisites must be 
met:


  *

    Knowledge and Data must be rendered discoverable and then
    transformed, linked, enriched and integrated homogeneously in a huge
    semantic knowledge graph

  *

    Language Technologies must be on the one hand leveraged to
    understand, categorize and structure available textual content in
    all its forms. On the other hand, language technology must assist in
    building adequate interfaces that allow humans to interact
    effectively with data and information via discovery, querying and
    reorganization.


Research in this workshop focuses on contextualising data and ontologies 
as well as capturing deep linguistic knowledge to improve machine 
understanding.


  Topics

  *

    Knowledge Integration

      o

        Vocabularies and Models for integrating resources (and Ontology
        Engineering)

      o

        Dataset metrics and quality assessment

      o

        Query, federation and question answering

      o

        Metadata for linked data knowledge

      o

        Discoverability of data

  *

    Knowledge Extraction

      o

        NLP techniques for knowledge extraction and machine reading

      o

        Information extraction and ontology learning

      o

        Pattern recognition and extraction for IE

      o

        Resources and use cases

      o

        Approaches using mappings and their maintenance

&#8230; from structured sources (RDB, XML, JSON),from semi-structured sources 
(XHTML), from unstructured sources (Text)*
