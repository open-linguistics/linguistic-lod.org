<PRE>============================================================
SECOND CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS 

THE LAW CHALLENGE

A Special Session of The 6th Linguistic Annotation Workshop (The LAW VI)
Held in conjunction with ACL 2012
July 12-13, 2012
Jeju, Republic of Korea          
<A HREF="http://faculty.washington.edu/fxia/LAWVI/challenge.html">http://faculty.washington.edu/fxia/LAWVI/challenge.html</A>                     

Winner's travel support provided by The US National Science Foundation (NSF) 

Submission deadline : 18 March 2012
=============================================================
                                   
LAW VI will include a special &quot;challenge&quot; session, sponsored by the US National Science 
Foundation (IIS 0948101 Content of Linguistic Annotation: Standards and Practices (CLASP)) 
and the ACL Special Interest Group on Annotation (ACL SIGANN). The goals of the challenge 
are to promote the use and collaborative development of open, shared resources, and to 
identify and promote best practices for annotation interoperability. 
 
Submissions to the session will be evaluated by members of the LAW program committee. 
Based on their recommendations, one paper will receive an award of up to US $2500 to cover 
the author's (or authors') travel expenses, including air fare, local ground transportation, 
hotel for one or two nights, and workshop registration. All papers accepted for the session 
will be presented and included in the LAW VI proceedings. 

Evaluation criteria will include (but are not necessarily limited to) the following :   

* innovative use of linguistic information from different annotation layers
* demonstrable interoperability with at least one other annotation scheme or format 
  developed by others
* quality of the annotated resource in terms of scheme design, documentation, tool support, etc.
* open availability of developed resources for community use
* usability and reusability of the annotation scheme or annotated resource
* outstanding contribution to the development of annotation best practices 

We invite long paper submissions describing original, innovative projects involving linguistic 
annotations that reflect the state-of-the-art in best practice for annotation development, 
creation, and/or use. Papers must follow the deadlines and format for LAW submissions, described 
at <A HREF="http://faculty.washington.edu/fxia/LAWVI.">http://faculty.washington.edu/fxia/LAWVI.</A> Where possible, submissions should describe projects 
that involve freely available, standard shared resources (e.g., MASC: <A HREF="http://www.anc.org/MASC/">http://www.anc.org/MASC/</A> 
for English). If appropriate, submitters should also register their annotation categories with ISOCat 
(<A HREF="http://www.isocat.org">http://www.isocat.org</A>) or make similar efforts to provide detailed information for such categories 
that can be referenced by others. In the case of MASC, all new annotations or derived data should 
be subsequently contributed for free use by the entire community.

Important dates
Submission deadline : 18 March 2012
Acceptance Notification: 15 April, 2012
Camera ready deadline : 30 April 2012
