<PRE>Currently the graph is a mix of
data and schema. Olia, lemon, powla and gold are really only ways of representing data, not the data sets themselves. 

In the future, we might add a &quot;verse&quot; at the end. I.e. lemonverse or powlaverse as the accumulation of data sets converted to /represented in lemon or powla. This will be made clear in future diagrams... We should all think about a way to represent this adequately in graphical form .

Hi all,

Fantastic site! 

Could the POWLA suffix on the three corpus resources be eliminated in the diagram, and then have the POWLA connection explained somewhere? As it is, it is a bit confusing, since there is no explanation of what this means to people who are familiar with the original data--even moreso because POWLA is there as its own entity.

Thanks,
Nancy

&gt;<i> Dear all,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> this is to announce the new website for the LLOD cloud diagram (<A HREF="http://linguistics.okfn.org/llod">http://linguistics.okfn.org/llod</A>), and the corresponding wiki page (<A HREF="http://wiki.okfn.org/Wg/linguistics/llod">http://wiki.okfn.org/Wg/linguistics/llod</A>). Now, both contain descriptions of the LLOD cloud diagram, its development and how to participate -- and an updated version of the diagram with hyperlinks pointing to the respective resources.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The LLOD cloud summarizes efforts of various OWLG members to create a Linked Open Data (sub-)cloud of linguistic resources, it is a concrete result of the last two telcos, in its appearance inspired by the LOD cloud diagram by Richard Cyganiak and Anja Jentzsch. The diagram includes linguistic resources (lexical-semantic resources, corpora, metadata repositories and linguistic data bases) that have been published in Linked Data format, or that will be published as such. For those resources that have not yet been made publicly available, their authors have made commitments to provide the data at some later point in time. With more and more resources being published, the diagram will be restricted to resources that are available under an open license, and links that have been really implemented rather than envisioned. Until that point, it should be referred to as a *draft for an* LLOD cloud diagram, and mostly serve as a basis for subsequent discussions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The diagram is published under a CC-BY license, and it is attributed to the working group as a whole, not a particular individual. Using a Mercurial repository, it can be edited in a collaborative manner, see <A HREF="http://wiki.okfn.org/Wg/linguistics/llod#How_to_contribute.">http://wiki.okfn.org/Wg/linguistics/llod#How_to_contribute.</A> Please feel invited to contribute. Also, it would probably be a good idea if we could document the continuous progress of the cloud in joint publications. Based on the state of affairs in October 2011, Sebastian Hellmann, Sebastian Nordhoff and myself have written a paper where we describe the potential of a LLOD cloud for representative examples of linguistic resources by linking lexical-semantic resources (DBpedia), linguistic data bases (Glottolog/Langdoc, OLiA) and annotated corpora (POWLA). However, this is not intended to serve as a reference publication for the LLOD cloud or the diagram; for such a reference publication, we would appreciate if more (if not all) contributors would be directly involved.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The current diagram was created with inkscape in svg. Earlier versions built with OmniGraffle, Powerpoint or Cacoo are hereby deprecated. The svg version also includes clickable hyperlinks to the resources or their documentation. (Some missing hyperlinks will be added with the next update.) Unfortunately, these hyperlinks cannot be exported to pdf.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Comments on the diagram can be directly posted to the mailing list. (Confidential messages can be sent to the list administrators, <A HREF="https://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-linguistics">open-linguistics-owner at lists.okfn.org.</A>) If you have other resources that you would like to see included, you can either add them yourselves (as described in <A HREF="http://wiki.okfn.org/Wg/linguistics/llod#How_to_contribute">http://wiki.okfn.org/Wg/linguistics/llod#How_to_contribute</A>) or ask the list administrators for help. Feedback, criticism, and possible additions are highly appreciated.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Dear all,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a key result of the last telco were commitments by several participants to provide different types of linguistic data, including various lexical-semantic resources (marked green), corpora (marked orange), and meta data repositories (marked blue).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have summarized possible links between resources we discussed at this occasion in the diagram under <A HREF="https://cacoo.com/diagrams/jmtxae5nl0vuYblW.">https://cacoo.com/diagrams/jmtxae5nl0vuYblW.</A> For the abbreviations used, please see the minutes of the last telco under <A HREF="http://okfnpad.org/OWLG.">http://okfnpad.org/OWLG.</A> (Unfortunately, cacoo does not support arrows, so, all [more or less] horizontal lines are to be read as directed edges pointing from left to right, whereas vertical lines indicate bidirectional linking -- suggestions for alternative software for collaborative graph drawing are highly welcome.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The diagram can be edited online. So far, only resources were considered that the participants of the telco were directly involved with. Please feel free to add additional resources already available from the LOD cloud or that can be provided online.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The linking between the resources as shown there is partly hypothetical and not yet implemented, and should be discussed more thoroughly in the next telco. Additionally, one should take linking granularity into account. As Judith pointed out before, linking Wiktionary dumps at the lexeme level would be easy, but Wiktionary *sense* level alignment could be tricky (no stability for sense IDs).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In my opinion, would be sufficient have a coarse-grained (and partially trivial) linking between resources at the moment, to release the data in this form openly and to invite others to develop their own and possibly less trivial linkings. For example, I would expect that an algorithm that automatically creates a sense-level linking out of an lexeme-level linking (e.g., on the basis of the comments associated with it) for, say, WordNet and Wiktionary, should also be applicable to different Wiktionary dumps.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Best,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Christian
