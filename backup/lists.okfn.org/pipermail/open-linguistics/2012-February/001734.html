<PRE>Dear all,

this is to announce the new website for the LLOD cloud diagram  
(<A HREF="http://linguistics.okfn.org/llod">http://linguistics.okfn.org/llod</A>), and the corresponding wiki page  
(<A HREF="http://wiki.okfn.org/Wg/linguistics/llod">http://wiki.okfn.org/Wg/linguistics/llod</A>). Now, both contain descriptions  
of the LLOD cloud diagram, its development and how to participate -- and  
an updated version of the diagram with hyperlinks pointing to the  
respective resources.

The LLOD cloud summarizes efforts of various OWLG members to create a  
Linked Open Data (sub-)cloud of linguistic resources, it is a concrete  
result of the last two telcos, in its appearance inspired by the LOD cloud  
diagram by Richard Cyganiak and Anja Jentzsch. The diagram includes  
linguistic resources (lexical-semantic resources, corpora, metadata  
repositories and linguistic data bases) that have been published in Linked  
Data format, or that will be published as such. For those resources that  
have not yet been made publicly available, their authors have made  
commitments to provide the data at some later point in time. With more and  
more resources being published, the diagram will be restricted to  
resources that are available under an open license, and links that have  
been really implemented rather than envisioned. Until that point, it  
should be referred to as a *draft for an* LLOD cloud diagram, and mostly  
serve as a basis for subsequent discussions.

The diagram is published under a CC-BY license, and it is attributed to  
the working group as a whole, not a particular individual. Using a  
Mercurial repository, it can be edited in a collaborative manner, see  
<A HREF="http://wiki.okfn.org/Wg/linguistics/llod#How_to_contribute.">http://wiki.okfn.org/Wg/linguistics/llod#How_to_contribute.</A> Please feel  
invited to contribute. Also, it would probably be a good idea if we could  
document the continuous progress of the cloud in joint publications. Based  
on the state of affairs in October 2011, Sebastian Hellmann, Sebastian  
Nordhoff and myself have written a paper where we describe the potential  
of a LLOD cloud for representative examples of linguistic resources by  
linking lexical-semantic resources (DBpedia), linguistic data bases  
(Glottolog/Langdoc, OLiA) and annotated corpora (POWLA). However, this is  
not intended to serve as a reference publication for the LLOD cloud or the  
diagram; for such a reference publication, we would appreciate if more (if  
not all) contributors would be directly involved.

The current diagram was created with inkscape in svg. Earlier versions  
built with OmniGraffle, Powerpoint or Cacoo are hereby deprecated. The svg  
version also includes clickable hyperlinks to the resources or their  
documentation. (Some missing hyperlinks will be added with the next  
update.) Unfortunately, these hyperlinks cannot be exported to pdf.

Comments on the diagram can be directly posted to the mailing list.  
(Confidential messages can be sent to the list administrators,  
<A HREF="https://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-linguistics">open-linguistics-owner at lists.okfn.org.</A>) If you have other resources that  
you would like to see included, you can either add them yourselves (as  
described in <A HREF="http://wiki.okfn.org/Wg/linguistics/llod#How_to_contribute">http://wiki.okfn.org/Wg/linguistics/llod#How_to_contribute</A>)  
or ask the list administrators for help. Feedback, criticism, and possible  
additions are highly appreciated.

Best,
Christian (+ Sebastian H. + Sebastian N.)

&gt;<i> Dear all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> a key result of the last telco were commitments by several participants  
</I>&gt;<i> to provide different types of linguistic data, including various  
</I>&gt;<i> lexical-semantic resources (marked green), corpora (marked orange), and  
</I>&gt;<i> meta data repositories (marked blue).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have summarized possible links between resources we discussed at this  
</I>&gt;<i> occasion in the diagram under  
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://cacoo.com/diagrams/jmtxae5nl0vuYblW.">https://cacoo.com/diagrams/jmtxae5nl0vuYblW.</A> For the abbreviations used,  
</I>&gt;<i> please see the minutes of the last telco under <A HREF="http://okfnpad.org/OWLG.">http://okfnpad.org/OWLG.</A>  
</I>&gt;<i> (Unfortunately, cacoo does not support arrows, so, all [more or less]  
</I>&gt;<i> horizontal lines are to be read as directed edges pointing from left to  
</I>&gt;<i> right, whereas vertical lines indicate bidirectional linking --  
</I>&gt;<i> suggestions for alternative software for collaborative graph drawing are  
</I>&gt;<i> highly welcome.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The diagram can be edited online. So far, only resources were considered  
</I>&gt;<i> that the participants of the telco were directly involved with. Please  
</I>&gt;<i> feel free to add additional resources already available from the LOD  
</I>&gt;<i> cloud or that can be provided online.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The linking between the resources as shown there is partly hypothetical  
</I>&gt;<i> and not yet implemented, and should be discussed more thoroughly in the  
</I>&gt;<i> next telco. Additionally, one should take linking granularity into  
</I>&gt;<i> account. As Judith pointed out before, linking Wiktionary dumps at the  
</I>&gt;<i> lexeme level would be easy, but Wiktionary *sense* level alignment could  
</I>&gt;<i> be tricky (no stability for sense IDs).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In my opinion, would be sufficient have a coarse-grained (and partially  
</I>&gt;<i> trivial) linking between resources at the moment, to release the data in  
</I>&gt;<i> this form openly and to invite others to develop their own and possibly  
</I>&gt;<i> less trivial linkings. For example, I would expect that an algorithm  
</I>&gt;<i> that automatically creates a sense-level linking out of an lexeme-level  
</I>&gt;<i> linking (e.g., on the basis of the comments associated with it) for,  
</I>&gt;<i> say, WordNet and Wiktionary, should also be applicable to different  
</I>&gt;<i> Wiktionary dumps.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best,
</I>&gt;<i> Christian
