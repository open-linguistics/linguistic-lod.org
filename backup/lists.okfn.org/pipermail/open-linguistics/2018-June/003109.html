Indian language technology stands at a critical juncture today. On one
hand, linguistic and cultural diversities give Indian languages freedom and
independence; make them dynamic; on the other hand, the lack of technology
and related resources, is making them less competitive in the digital age.
The ability of the Sanskrit language i.e. its standard grammar;
acceptability and closeness with the four main language families along with
the computational complexity of 1761 languages, has attracted the language
technology community.

The influence of Sanskrit has been significant not only on all Indian
languages but also on Indian culture and mind. About 77% of the languages
belong to the Indo Aryan family and almost all the scripts come from
Brahmi. The Paninian system and vocabulary, linguistic and literary
criteria &#8211; all have been influential on the entire linguistic map of India.

In view of the above role and facts; and the Indian government's
undertakings in Indian languages; also keeping in view the absence of
technology and related content, JNU and the Bhartiya Bhasha Manch have
decided to jointly organize a 3 day conference to initiate a discussion on
the present status of language technology for Indian languages and
formulate guidelines for further research initiatives.

The broader objectives of the SOIL-Tech will be

   -

   To create a White Paper for 22 scheduled Indian languages
   -

   To investigate challenges related to creating and sharing various levels
   of language resources on Sanskrit and Other Indian languages
   -

   To provide a space for dialogue between Indian language resource
   developers and users
   -

   To form dedicated groups in creating critical technologies for Indian
   languages

*DATES *

July 29, 2018 Paper submissions due

August 29, 2018 Notification of results

September 10, 2018 Camera-ready papers due

October 11-13, 2018 Conference

*SUBMISSIONS*

Papers must describe original, completed or in progress, and unpublished
work. Each submission will be reviewed by at least two program committee
members.

Accepted papers will be given up to 10-20 pages (for white papers), 10
pages (for research papers) and 5 pages for short papers/posters in the
conference proceedings and can be presented as either oral presentation or
poster.

Papers should be formatted according to the SOIL-Tech style-sheet, which
will be provided on the SOIL-Tech 2018 website. Please submit papers in PDF
format through EasyChair website
(*<A HREF="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=soiltech2018">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=soiltech2018</A>
&lt;<A HREF="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=soiltech2018">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=soiltech2018</A>&gt;*).

We are seeking submissions under the following categories

   -

   Full papers (10 pages)
   -

   Short papers (work in progress &#8211; 5 pages)

In the past few years, as more resources have been developed and made
available, an increased activity in the development of usable technology
with reference to White Papers has been observed. Hence, SOIL-Tech
conference will put special focus on &#8220;white papers&#8221; of Indian Language
Technology on similar lines as done by the EU&#8217;s project META-NET. In
addition, we are inviting technical, policy and position paper submissions
on the following topics related to Indian Language Technological resources:

   -

   Corpora - text, speech, multimodal, methodologies, annotation and tools
   -

   Digital Humanities
   -

   E-learning
   -

   Formal grammars
   -

   Heritage computing
   -

   Information Extraction and retrieval,
   -

   Language resources for NLP,
   -

   Lexicons and Machine-readable dictionaries
   -

   Machine Translation
   -

   Ontologies
   -

   Strategies for digitization of ancient manuscripts
   -

   Digital Library
   -

   Speech Technology
   -

   Standards or specifications for language resources applications
   -

   Web Semantics

Both, submissions and review processes, will be handled electronically. The
review process will be *double-blind*. The conference website will provide
submission guidelines very soon.
