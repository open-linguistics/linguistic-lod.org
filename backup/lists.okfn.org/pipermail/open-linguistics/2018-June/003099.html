<PRE>Dear colleagues, 

Please be informed that we extended the deadline of the 4th Workshop on Semantic Deep Learning (SemDeep-4) collocated with ISWC to June 4. 

Kind regards,
Dagmar 


EXTENDED DEADLINE OF THE 

4TH WORKSHOP ON SEMANTIC DEEP LEARNING (SemDeep-4) @ ISWC 2018

Monterey, California

Semantic Web (SW) Technologies and Deep Learning (DL) share the goal of creating intelligent artifacts. Both disciplines have had a remarkable impact in data and knowledge analysis, as well as knowledge representation, and in fact constitute two complementary directions for modeling expressible linguistic phenomena and solving semantically complex problems. In this context, and following the main foundations set in past editions, SemDeep-4 aims to bring together SW and DL research as well as industrial communities. 

SemDeep is interested in contributions of DL to classic problems in semantic applications, such as: (semi-automated) ontology learning, ontology alignment, ontology annotation, duplicate recognition, ontology prediction, knowledge base completion, relation extraction, and semantically grounded inference, among many others. At the same time, we invite contributions that analyse the interaction of SW technologies and resources with DL architectures, such as knowledge-based embeddings, collocation discovery and classification, or lexical entailment, to name only a few. This workshop seeks to provide an 
invigorating environment where semantically challenging problems which appeal 
to both Semantic Web and Computational Linguistics communities are addressed and 
discussed.

We invite submissions on any approach combining Semantic Web technologies and 
Deep Learning and suggest the following topics.

Structured knowledge in deep learning.

  *   neural networks and logic rules for semantic compositionality
  *   learning and applying knowledge graph embeddings to NLP tasks
  *   learning semantic similarity and encoding distances as knowledge graph
  *   ontology-based text classification
  *   multilingual resources for neural representations of linguistics
  *   semantic role labeling

Reasoning and inferences and deep learning

  *   commonsense reasoning and vector space models
  *   reasoning with deep learning methods
  *   learning knowledge representations with deep learning
  *   deep learning methods for knowledge-base completion
  *   deep ontology learning
  *   deep learning models for learning knowledge representations from text
  *   deep learning ontological annotations

IMPORTANT DATES

*Firm* Submission deadline: June 4, 2018
Notification of acceptance: June 27, 2018
Camera-ready version: July 20, 2018
Workshop dates: October 8-9, 2018

SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

We invite three types of submissions:

  1.  Long papers with new results (max. 12 pages)

  2.  Short papers presenting innovative not fully empirically validated ideas 
or position papers (max. 4 pages)

  3.  Short descriptions of systems that participate in the demo jam (max. 4 
pages)

All papers need to follow the LCNS formatting guidelines. The demo jam takes 
the format of system demonstrations where the theoretical background may be 
explained in the presentation slot and the functioning of the system is 
showcased in a 5 minute demo.
