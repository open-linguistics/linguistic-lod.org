<PRE>We invite applications for a postdoctoral and research assistant position
at the Data Science Institute of the National University of Ireland Galway
in machine learning for NLP with specific emphasis on sequence-to-sequence
learning for applications such as Neural Machine Translation, ChatBots,
Summarization and others.

The Data Science Institute (DSI) of the National University of Ireland
Galway [1] hosts the Insight Centre for Data Analytics [2], a collaboration
between several universities in Ireland. Insight is the biggest dedicated
research centre in data analytics in Europe. The positions will be
associated with the Unit for Natural Language Processing [3] at DSI/Insight.

Main responsibilities for the postdoctoral position include (but are not
limited to):

   -

   Performing research in sequence-to-sequence learning for applications
   such as Neural Machine Translation (NMT), ChatBots and Summarization. In
   the context of NMT, specific emphasis is on on the injection of external
   knowledge (linguistic and terminological) into the NMT framework and
   investigating multi-way NMT models for under-resourced domain-specific
   scenarios.
   -

   Coordinate project work, advise other project members and support the PI
   in project-related day-to-day business


Candidates for this position should have a PhD degree in a relevant field
of study with an emphasis on areas such as neural machine translation,
machine learning or natural language processing. The position is for a
fixed period of 12 months with the possibility of extension, depending on
successful acquisition of project funding in which the selected candidate
will be expected to actively participate.

Salary range: &#8364;39k &#8211; &#8364;45k per annum, (commensurate with qualifications and
experience)

Main responsibilities for the research assistant position include (but are
not limited to):

   -

   Developing approaches for data collection and curation, incorporating
   linguistic and terminological information into sequence-to-sequence models
   and exploiting multi-way models for under-resourced domain-specific
   scenarios.
   -

   Assisting on experiments for understanding sequence-to-sequence models
   for applications in NLP.


Candidates for this position should have a MSc or equivalent in a relevant
field of study with an emphasis on areas such as machine learning or
natural language processing. The candidate should have good programming
skills in python (preferably experience with pytorch). The position is for
a fixed period of 12 months with the possibility of extension, depending on
successful acquisition of project funding.

Salary range: &#8364;23 &#8211; &#8364;34k per annum, (commensurate with qualifications and
experience)

Send your application (CV and cover letter, both in PDF only) by May 1st,
2018 to Dr. Mihael Arcan: <A HREF="https://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-linguistics">mihael.arcan at insight-centre.org</A>
