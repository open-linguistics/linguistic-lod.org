<PRE>Call for papers

*Special Issue of *Terminology* on*
Terminology and e-dictionaries

Introduction

In a globalised society, Terminology dictionaries, including all kinds of
resources (knowledge and terminology databases, ontologies, wordnets,
&#8220;traditional&#8221; dictionaries, etc.), should respond not only to human needs,
but also to machine needs.

The changes regarding information and language processing demanded by the
evolution of society have a series of consequences in: (i) the design of
terminological resources; (ii) the way data and knowledge are represented;
(iii) the way data are interrelated both within the resource and between
resources; (iv) the way users access data; and (v) users&#8217; expectations.

In recent years, the creation of a number of electronic terminological
resources has involved theoretical, methodological and technical advances,
which have provided solutions to different issues related to content,
search techniques and resource maintenance.

At present, a large number of terminological resources are available in
different formats and in different languages. However, difficulties in
accessing and searching in a given environment or in their integration with
other tools often hampers their availability.

In this special issue, authors are invited to describe their experiences
related to the creation and use of electronic terminological dictionaries
and, in particular, to reflect on the ways in which such terminological
data and resources can be connected, integrated or made interoperable, so
that the user (whether human or machine) can access and share them more
effectively. We believe that now, after a number of years working on these
topics, it is time to rethink this new reality.
Topics of the issue

Contributions from authors are expected to report on their experiences of
dealing with one or more of the following issues:

&#183;         Integration of terminological resources in different devices or
applications, or their connection with other systems (such as machine
translation).

&#183;         Methods of creation and design of electronic dictionaries, their
maintenance and updating: computational and/or linguistic aspects.

&#183;         Comparison between lexicographic and terminological dictionaries.
Processing of terms in general electronic dictionaries.

&#183;         Similarities and differences between electronic dictionaries,
lexical resources, conceptual networks, ontologies.

&#183;         Use of electronic dictionaries, search and query forms, user
profiles.

&#183;         Description of dictionary entries (denomination, grammatical
category, definition, equivalences, images) and the forms of connection
between them (links, cross references).

&#183;         Representation and computational processing of terminological
data, syntagmatic and paradigmatic relations, semantic relations between
terms (hierarchies of concepts, networks, etc.) in electronic dictionaries.


Submissions

Papers should be written using Word and have a length of between 20 and 30
pages (max. 9,000 words). More information on formatting requirements can
be found on the John Benjamins website (
<A HREF="http://benjamins.com/#catalog/journals/term">http://benjamins.com/#catalog/journals/term</A>). English is preferred (80% of
the contents), but submissions in French, Spanish or German will be
considered. Each issue of *Terminology* contains up to six or seven
articles.

Please send submissions to Amparo Alcina (<A HREF="https://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-linguistics">alcina at uji.es</A>) or Rute Costa (
