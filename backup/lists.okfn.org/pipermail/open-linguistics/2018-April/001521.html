<PRE>Call for Papers

Fourth International Workshop on 'Future Big Data' (FBD 2018)

In Conjunction with the Thirteenth International Conference on Digital 
Information Management (ICDIM 2018)
<A HREF="http://www.icdim.org/workshop.php">http://www.icdim.org/workshop.php</A>
Berlin, Germany
September 24-26, 2018

Technically co-sponsored by the IEEE Technology Management Council
Accepted workshop papers will be published in the proceedings indexed by 
IEEE Xplore.

About the Workshop

Big Data concern large-volume, complex, growing data sets with multiple, 
autonomous sources. The developments in the Big Data research lead to 
almost the birth of a new domain. With the fast development of 
networking, data storage, and the data collection capacity, Big Data are 
now rapidly expanding in all science and engineering domains, including 
physical, biological and biomedical sciences. This workshop will address 
the features of the Big Data revolution, Big Data processing model, data 
driven models, big data standards, and so on.

Topics to be addressed in the workshop, but not limited to:

- Big Data models and architectures
- Big data architecture and design
- Security, privacy, and trust
- Data protection and integrity
- Big Data mining, analytics and metrics
- Data representation and structures
- Data capturing and acquisition
- Tools and technologies
- QoS of big data
- Social networks analysis
- Big Data searching and mining
- Visualisation of data
- Personal data logging and quantified-self
- Context-aware data
- Big Data Visualization
- Personalisation of data
- Data contextualisation
- Data Querying
- Applications of open and linked data
- Data-intensive computing,
- Methodologies and cases studies
- Data Usability issues
- Storages and network requirements
- Bigdata Network models and protocols
- Big data in cloud and IoT
- Big data processing large-scale datasets on clusters
- Smart and connected communities
- Big Data and Urban Data Analytics
- Cloud Computing and Network Infrastructure for Smart Cities
- Intelligent Transport Systems and Traffic Management
- Big data for Internet of Things

Submissions

Submissions should provide original and unpublished research results or 
ongoing research with simulations. The papers should be between 6 to 8 
pages total in length in the IEEE format.
