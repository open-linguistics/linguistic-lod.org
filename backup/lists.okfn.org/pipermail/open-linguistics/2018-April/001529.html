<PRE>*IEEE Big Data 2018 Call for Workshop Proposals*

2018 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (IEEE Big Data 2018)
<A HREF="http://cci.drexel.edu/bigdata/bigdata2018/index.html">http://cci.drexel.edu/bigdata/bigdata2018/index.html</A>

December 10-13, 2018, Seattle, WA, USA
=================================================================

The Program Committees of the 2018 IEEE International Conference on Big
Data (IEEE Big Data 2018) invite proposals for Workshops.  Selected
workshops will hold a central position within the larger conference, which
will bring together top academic and industrial researchers from all over
the world to exchange cutting edge research ideas in Big Data research,
development and practice.  Within these fields, workshops at Big Data form
crucial focal points for emerging communities and forums for the
examination of new ideas.

Here are a summary of the conferences in the previous years:

 The IEEE Big Data conference series started in 2013 has established
 itself as the top tier research conference in Big Data.

1.     The first conference IEEE Big Data 2013 (
<A HREF="http://cci.drexel.edu/bigdata/bigdata2013/">http://cci.drexel.edu/bigdata/bigdata2013/</A> regular paper acceptance  rate:
17.0%)was held in Santa Clara, CA from Oct 6-9, 2013 with more  than  400
registered participants from 40 countries.

2.     The IEEE Big Data 2014 (
<A HREF="http://cci.drexel.edu/bigdata/bigdata2014/index.htm,">http://cci.drexel.edu/bigdata/bigdata2014/index.htm,</A> regular paper
acceptance rate: 18.5.0%) was held in Washington DC, Oct 27-30, 2014 with
more than 600 registered participants from 45 countries.

3.     The IEEE Big Data 2015 ( <A HREF="http://cci.drexel.edu/bigdata/bigdata2015/">http://cci.drexel.edu/bigdata/bigdata2015/</A> ,
regular paper acceptance rate: 16.8%) was held in Santa Clara, Oct29-Nov
1, 2015 with more than 780 registered participants from 49 countries.

4.     The IEEE Big Data 2016 ( <A HREF="http://cci.drexel.edu/bigdata/bigdata2016/">http://cci.drexel.edu/bigdata/bigdata2016/</A> ,
regular paper acceptance rate: 18.7%) was held in Washington DC, Dec 5-8,
2016 with close to 900 registered participants from 43 countries.

5.     The IEEE Big Data 2017 ( <A HREF="http://cci.drexel.edu/bigdata/bigdata2017/">http://cci.drexel.edu/bigdata/bigdata2017/</A> ,
regular paper acceptance rate: 17.8%) was held in Boston, MA, Dec 11-14,
2017 with close to 1000 registered participants from 50 countries.





The 2018 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (IEEE Big Data 2018)
will continue the success of the previous IEEE Big Data conferences. It
will provide a leading forum for disseminating the latest research in Big
Data Research, Development, and Applications.



Workshop organizers will be responsible for advertising the workshop,
forming the program committees, reviewing and selecting the papers, and
guaranteeing a high quality worthy of the prestige and breadth of the
Conference.  All papers accepted for workshops will be included in the
Workshop Proceedings published by the IEEE Computer Society Press, made
available at the Conference.

The workshop organizers will also have the discretion of editing selected
papers (after their expansion and revision) into books or special journal
issues.  Workshops should cover at least a single session (6 regular
papers). The workshop organizers should ensure registration and presence of
  authors of accepted papers.

*Workshop Topics*

Each workshop subject will focus on new research challenges and initiatives
in Big Data.  The workshops should provide an informal and vibrant forum
for researchers and industry practitioners to share their research results
and practical development experiences in Big Data research, development and
practice.  Workshop topics may be narrow, e.g., Clouding Computing/Grid
Computing/Stream Computing for Big Data; Big Data stream Mining, Big Graph
Data Mining,   or broad, e.g., Big Data Foundations , Big Data management,
Big Data Mining and Searching, Big Data Privacy and Security, Big Data
Application,  etc (Pls refer to the IEEE Big Data 2018
<A HREF="http://cci.drexel.edu/bigdata/bigdata2018/index.html">http://cci.drexel.edu/bigdata/bigdata2018/index.html</A> for more possible
workshop topics). Prospective workshop organizers are encouraged to contact
workshop chairs for feedback.
