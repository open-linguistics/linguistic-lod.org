<PRE>CALL FOR PAPERS

AIMSA 2018

The 18th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence: Methodology, 
Systems, Applications
- AI and Deep Learning -

Golden Sands resort, Varna, Bulgaria, 12-14th September, 2018

www.aimsaconference.org

Initiated in 1984, the biennial Artificial Intelligence: Methodology, 
Systems, Applications (AIMSA) conference is a premier forum for exchanging 
information and research results on AI theory and principles along with 
applications of intelligent system technology. The conference traditionally 
brings together academic and industrial researchers from all areas of AI to 
share their ideas and experiences and learn about the research in 
contemporary AI. As its name indicates, the conference is dedicated to 
Artificial Intelligence in its entirety. However, for AIMSA 2018, we would 
like to put an emphasis on Deep Learning (DL) as it has been used 
successfully in many applications, and is considered one of the most 
cutting-edge machine learning and AI techniques at the moment. Of course, 
the focus on DL does not preclude submission of papers on other interesting 
topics and approaches in AI.

The 18th edition of AIMSA will be held in the beautiful Varna area, 
Bulgaria. With excellent opportunities for outdoor activities, water sports 
and gastronomy, Varna promises to be a wonderful venue for a memorable 
conference.

TOPICS

The conference welcomes submissions of original, high quality papers in all 
areas of Artificial Intelligence, including (but not limited to) traditional 
topics such as search, machine learning, planning, knowledge representation, 
reasoning, natural language processing, robotics and perception, multiagent 
systems, etc.

We especially welcome papers on end-to-end learning; multi-task learning; 
cross- and multi-modal learning; combinations of DL and knowledge-based 
approaches; transparency, explainability, stability and provability of DL; 
DL meta-learning in AI etc., as well as papers that bring useful 
computational technologies from other areas of computer science into AI.

All submissions will be subject to academic peer review by at least two 
members of the program committee. Selection criteria include accuracy and 
originality of ideas, clarity and significance of results, and quality of 
presentation.

For each accepted paper, at least one author is required to attend the 
conference to present the paper.

The best paper of the conference will receive the Best Paper Award during 
the conference.

IMPORTANT DATES

Submission deadline:                          May 20, 2018

PROCEEDINGS

AIMSA 2018 Proceedings will be by Springer in their Lecture Notes in 
Artificial Intelligence subline of the Lecture Notes in Computer Science 
series.
