*** Postdoc in NLP at TakeLab, University of Zagreb (Jan 2017) ***

Text Analysis and Knowledge Engineering Lab (TakeLab) at the University
of Zagreb, Croatia, invites applications for a postdoctoral researcher
in Natural Language Processing within the project &quot;SenseHive: Dynamic
Crowdsourcing Models for Incremental Construction of Lexico-Semantic
Resources&quot;.

The SenseHive project (<A HREF="http://www.sensehive.org">http://www.sensehive.org</A>) investigates the
computational models for cost-efficient crowdsourcing of large-scale
word sense inventories. The project combines research in crowdsourcing,
corpus-based models of semantics, and unsupervised/active machine
learning. The project is funded by the Croatian Science Foundation
(Principal Investigator: Prof. Dr. Jan Snajder).

Requirements:

Candidates will have completed a PhD in Computer Science or
Computational Linguistics and be able to demonstrate a track record of
independent research and strong publications. Experience with machine
learning, lexical semantics, distributional semantics, statistical data
analysis, or crowdsourcing would be highly valuable. Good programming
skills, proficiency in spoken and written English, as well as a keen
interest in problem solving and research are essential.

Salary and contract duration:

This is a full-time, fixed-term post for 21 months, starting on 1
January 2017. Salary is in accordance with the university regulations
for academic personnel (salary coefficient 1.6, monthly net salary of
around 7.200 HRK).

Application:

Applications can be made by e-mail at <A HREF="https://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-linguistics">jan.snajder at fer.hr</A> and should
include a short research statement, CV, copy of university degrees and
transcripts, and (if available) a copy of the PhD thesis, as well as
list of publications and published software. Please email all documents
as a single PDF.

All applications received before 22 November, 2016 will receive full
consideration. The position remains open until filled.

The University of Zagreb, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and
Computing, promotes gender equality and in particular encourages women
to apply. Disabled applicants will be preferred if they have the same
qualifications as non-disabled applicants.

About the Lab:

TakeLab (<A HREF="http://takelab.fer.hr/">http://takelab.fer.hr/</A>) is a young and dynamic research team
and the leading group for Natural Language Processing and Text Analytics
in Croatia. The group pursues diverse research topics, ranging from
information extraction and semantic search to computational semantics
and opinion mining.

Contact information:

Please contact Jan Snajder (<A HREF="https://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-linguistics">jan.snajder at fer.hr</A>) for additional information.
