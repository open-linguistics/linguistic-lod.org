<PRE>Dear OWLG group,
you can find the minutes of our telco here: <A HREF="http://okfnpad.org/OWLG">http://okfnpad.org/OWLG</A>

In the telco, we concluded that we need an organizational structure for 
our group. The main rationale is that there seems to be a lot of 
activity on the one hand, but there seems to be a lack of information 
and coordination. Many of the tasks and todos are neither handled nor 
kept track of and the group effort is stagnating.

Here are the main issues, we are trying to tackle with an organisational 
structure for the group:
- how do we keep the web site up to date? (including blog posts)
- who schedules telcos?
- who can people ask, if they want to organize an OWLG workshop?
- how do we organize a procedure for issuing letters of support?
- ....

The Open Knowledge Foundation does not have any requirements for working 
group structures, so we are free to choose our own way. Also there 
doesn't seem to be any best practice. We therefore would like to ask you 
to make proposals on how to organize this group. The need is certainly 
obvious, as we seem to be stagnating.

Please post any problems, issues, wishes or proposals to this list until 
April 12th, so we can discuss this problem and make an informed decision,

all the best,
Sebastian
