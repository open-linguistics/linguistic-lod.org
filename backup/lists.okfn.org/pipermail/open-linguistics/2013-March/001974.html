<PRE>Why should scholarly communication preserve so conservatively
practices that were thought for a different technology?

Why should we pay for citation data? Lets talk
about this and much more at Semantic Publishing <A HREF="https://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-linguistics">Workshop at ESWC</A>
We have extended our submission deadline, now it is the 14th of March.

SePublica Semantic Publishing <A HREF="https://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-linguistics">Workshop at ESWC</A> (Montpellier 26-30 May);
deadline 14 March

Call for Participation: Sepublica 2013 -an ESWC Workshop

Machine-comprehensible Documents: Bridging the Gap between Publications
and Data.

** May 26-30, 2013, Montpelier, France.

Workshop Web site: <A HREF="http://sepublica.mywikipaper.org/drupal/">http://sepublica.mywikipaper.org/drupal/</A>

*** Relevant dates ***

Submission Deadline: March 14,2013
Acceptance Notification: April 1,2013
Camera-Ready: April 15,2013

*** Topics ***

Publishing of scholarly works is on the cusp of great change. Data is
now routinely published accompanied by or in some semantic form, but
this is not the case for scholarly works. Advances in technology have
made it possible for the scientific article to adopt electronic
dissemination channels, from paper-based journals to purely electronic
formats. Yet, despite the improvements in the distribution,
accessibility and retrieval of information, little has really changed in
the publishing of scholarly works compared to that of the data about
which scholarly works are written. The availability of data and the
open, digital form of scholarly works is leading to a drive to
semantically enable scholarly works to make the works themselves more
computationally useful as well as to link them intimately to the data
about which they are written. Sepublica is a forum in which to discuss
and present what is best and up and coming in semantic publishing.

How are new technologies changing scholarly communication? How do we
want scholarly communication to change? Where do we want it to go?
Semantics, within publication workflows, is usually added post hoc, how
could we support publications to be born semantic? At Sepublica we will
discuss and present new ways of publishing, sharing, linking, and
analyzing such scientific resources as well as reasoning over the data
to discover new links and scientific insights. Sepublica is not,
however, limited to the scientific domain; the humanities, cultural
industries, news, commerce etc. all have published works that can
benefit from semantic enhancement and data to which they can link; all
are welcome.

topics include, but are not limited to:
*     How could we realize a paper with an API? How could we have a
paper as a database, as a knowledge base?
*     How is the paper an interface, gateway, to the web of data? How
could such an interface be delivered in a contextual manner?
* How are semantic scholarly works to be created?
*     How are news agencies adopting technologies in support of their
publications? Has the delivered technology been adopted? What are the
experiences from news agencies been so far? Lessons learnt.
*     How could semantic technologies be used to represent the knowledge
encoded in scientific documents and in general-interest media publications?
*     Connecting scientific publications with underlying research data sets
*     What semantics and ontologies do we need for representing
structural elements in a document?
*     Moving from the bibliographic reference to the full content within
a linked
environment?

*** Call for Papers ***

Sepublica 2013 is soliciting submissions of novel (not previously
published nor concurrently submitted) research papers in the areas of
the topics outlined above. The organizing committee is happy to discuss
possible submissions with authors.

Submissions will be welcome from a broad range of approaches to semantic
publishing. We are particularly keen on submissions that are themselves
examples of semantic publishing of scholarly works. LaTeX documents in
the LNCS format can, e.g., be annotated using SALT or sTeX. We also
invite submissions in XHTML+RDFa or in the format of YOUR semantic
publishing tool. However, to ensure a fair review procedure, authors
must additionally produce a narrative submitted as a PDF that is
submitted as normal.

Submission is via EasyChair
(<A HREF="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sepublica2013">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sepublica2013</A>).
Papers must formatted according to the LNCS format

*** Submission Types ***

1. Full paper, 12 pages
2. Position paper, 5 pages.
3. Software demo papers, 2 pages
4. Late-breaking news, 1 page.

*** Contact ***

Please email <A HREF="https://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-linguistics">sepublica2013 at easychair.org</A> For any enquiries.
