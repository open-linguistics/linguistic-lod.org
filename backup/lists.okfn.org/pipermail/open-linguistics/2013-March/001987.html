<PRE>Thanks for this email. It is quite long, but well worth reading it, as 
it is a good analysis.

I came up with a more refined list of responsibilities and also a list 
of expected results to check, whether the person is taking his/her 
responsibilities serious. I think, we should demand some reliable 
commitment, but keep the tasks minimal, so not to overburden the people. 
I see the difference between our views much clearer now. Probably, both 
is the best, to have individual discipline, as well as a fixed group of 
people who motivate and coordinate contribution.

&quot;Admin&quot; is too technical, I would rather go for &quot;curator&quot; for 
content-focussed tasks or coordinator, if it is used with &quot;with&quot; as in 
&quot;coordinates with OKFN&quot;, e.g. for reporting.
Here is my incomplete list:
<A HREF="http://wiki.okfn.org/Wg/linguistics/tasks">http://wiki.okfn.org/Wg/linguistics/tasks</A>

Please refine, this is just a first shot. It is focused on managing our 
resources and it certainly neglects the issues raised by Christian.

However, imagine, if we, as a group, were to produce all the things in 
the expected results column. I would be very proud of our community.

All the best,
Sebastian

&gt;<i> Dear all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> first of all, thanks to Sebastian and Jonathan for their summaries.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for Sebastian's list, I would like to add one additional issue, 
</I>&gt;<i> that is
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - *Aggregate and facilitate communication*: one or few persons who 
</I>&gt;<i> keep track of what is going on, who feel responsible to make sure that 
</I>&gt;<i> there is something going on at all, who should be addressed if issues 
</I>&gt;<i> arise that pertain to the OWLG as a whole, and who redistribute this 
</I>&gt;<i> information through the website/blog, the mailing list and at the telcos.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course this covers some of the tasks that Sebastian mentioned, 
</I>&gt;<i> which are however, much more specific, and actually, somewhat 
</I>&gt;<i> orthogonal to this task. Maybe we should distinguish between 
</I>&gt;<i> responsibilities for concrete tasks and the responsibility to maintain 
</I>&gt;<i> an overview to make sure the group works as whole. I felt the latter 
</I>&gt;<i> was somewhat missing since the second half of last year.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Technically, this would be what a coordinator would be supposed to do, 
</I>&gt;<i> but as here are several communities involved, that normally don't come 
</I>&gt;<i> together at all, it would be recommendable that we appoint *several 
</I>&gt;<i> people* to this role that interface with their specific communities, 
</I>&gt;<i> say, the Semantic Web community, typology, and NLP/computational 
</I>&gt;<i> linguistics (so far, these have been most active, but suggestions for 
</I>&gt;<i> additional fields and candidates welcome). The main obligation would 
</I>&gt;<i> be to participate in *every* telco, and every possible meeting, and to 
</I>&gt;<i> stay in close contact with the other to keep up with the developments 
</I>&gt;<i> in case a telco/meeting is missed.
</I>&gt;<i> The number of people should not be too high, say, five at most, as 
</I>&gt;<i> telcos with 10 or more participants (we have had some fluctuation 
</I>&gt;<i> there) tend to be increasingly impractical.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, we had a very similar, but informal structure before, during 
</I>&gt;<i> and after LDL, and it worked pretty well for a while, just that 
</I>&gt;<i> without formal responsibilities, we stopped having telcos and meetings 
</I>&gt;<i> since the MLODE workshop, when people got occupied with more concrete 
</I>&gt;<i> tasks such as converting data sets, preparing data set descriptions 
</I>&gt;<i> and publishing their results. Actually, this was a consequence of our 
</I>&gt;<i> success, because the number of active people substantially increased 
</I>&gt;<i> and we had to specialize, loosing global coherence a little out of 
</I>&gt;<i> sight. Appointing a few people to compensate this natural 
</I>&gt;<i> particularization process seems necessary to keep the group working.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> From a terminological point of view, I would prefer not to use 
</I>&gt;<i> hierarchy-loaded terms like &quot;chair&quot; or &quot;coordinator&quot;, because we like 
</I>&gt;<i> to stay open to everyone who is interested in participating, but 
</I>&gt;<i> rather talk about &quot;administrators&quot;, as this job also should come with 
</I>&gt;<i> some technical responsibility (inseparable from the general task to 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;facilitate communication&quot;), such as mailing list administration 
</I>&gt;<i> (aside from OKFN people currently Sebastian Hellmann and me) or web 
</I>&gt;<i> site administration (aside from OKFN people currently Steve Moran, 
</I>&gt;<i> Sebastian Hellmann and me).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All the best,
</I>&gt;<i> Christian

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Dear OWLG group,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you can find the minutes of our telco here: <A HREF="http://okfnpad.org/OWLG">http://okfnpad.org/OWLG</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In the telco, we concluded that we need an organizational structure 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for our group. The main rationale is that there seems to be a lot of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> activity on the one hand, but there seems to be a lack of information 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and coordination. Many of the tasks and todos are neither handled nor 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> kept track of and the group effort is stagnating.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Here are the main issues, we are trying to tackle with an 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> organisational structure for the group:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - how do we keep the web site up to date? (including blog posts)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - who schedules telcos?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - who can people ask, if they want to organize an OWLG workshop?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - how do we organize a procedure for issuing letters of support?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - ....
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The Open Knowledge Foundation does not have any requirements for 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> working group structures, so we are free to choose our own way. Also 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there doesn't seem to be any best practice. We therefore would like 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to ask you to make proposals on how to organize this group. The need 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is certainly obvious, as we seem to be stagnating.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Please post any problems, issues, wishes or proposals to this list 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> until April 12th, so we can discuss this problem and make an informed 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decision,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all the best,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sebastian
