<PRE>15th Discovery Challenge - Recommending Given Names
organized in conjunction with ECML PKDD 2013
September 23rd to 27th, 2013, Prague, Czech Republic

All over the world, future parents are facing the task of finding 
suitable given names for their children. This choice is influenced by 
different factors, such as the social context, language, cultural 
background and especially personal taste. Typically, parents spent hours 
with browsing through endless lists of names, hoping to find the perfect 
name.

LET&#8217;S HELP THEM!

===============================================
1st ANNOUNCEMENT: 20DC13 CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
===============================================

This year&#8217;s ECML PKDD Discovery Challenge will address the task of 
recommending given names, that is, creating a recommender system for 
first names. Given a set of names for which a user has shown interest 
in, the recommender should provide suggestions for further names. The 
challenge is based on actual usage data of the name search platform 
nameling (<A HREF="http://nameling.net">http://nameling.net</A>), which attracted more than 60,000 users 
within less than a year.

The task of recommending names is new and thus any approach could yield 
a successful contribution. Even small pre-processing steps or 
applications of standard recommender systems can be valuable. Teams of 
any size and background (researchers, students, etc.) are welcome alike 
and we are very much looking forward to your contribution and seeing you 
at the 20DC13 workshop!

The challenge consists of two parts, an offline and an online challenge. 
In the offline challenge, participants develop a recommender that, given 
a set of names for which a user has shown interest in, provides as list 
of recommendations for that user. To win the offline challenge it is not 
mandatory to take part in the online challenge although all participants 
are welcome to integrate their recommender algorithms into the live system.

For detailed information regarding participation, task description and 
access to the data please check the official 20DC13-Callenge-Website:
