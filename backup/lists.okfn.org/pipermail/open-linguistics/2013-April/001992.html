<PRE>The 7th Linguistic Annotation Workshop and Interoperability with Discourse (LAW VII and ID)
Sponsored by the ACL Special Interest Group on Annotation (SIGANN)

Held in Conjunction with the 51st Annual Association for Computational Linguistics Conference (ACL'13)
Sofia, Bulgaria
August 8-9 2013
<A HREF="http://www.linguistics.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/law7-id">http://www.linguistics.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/law7-id</A>

NEW: The description and suggested data for the shared task have been released, see details at: <A HREF="http://nactem.ac.uk/law7-id/.">http://nactem.ac.uk/law7-id/.</A>

NEW: Revised Submission deadline: May 10th 2013 for the shared task, May 3rd 2013 for all other LAW &amp; ID papers.


Workshop overview
-----------------
Linguistic annotation of natural language corpora is the backbone of supervised methods for statistical natural language processing. It also provides valuable data for evaluation of both rule-based and supervised systems and can help formalize and study linguistic phenomena.

The LAW provides a forum for presentation and discussion of innovative research on all aspects of linguistic annotation, including creation/evaluation of annotation schemes, methods for automatic and manual annotation, use and evaluation of annotation software and frameworks, representation of linguistic data and annotations, etc. This year, a significant part of the workshop will focus on the special theme of Interoperability with Discourse.

Important dates
---------------
3 May 2013: Submission deadline for papers (NEW)
10 May 2013: Submission deadline for the shared task (NEW)
24 May 2013: Notification of Acceptance

Submissions
-----------
We welcome submissions of long (8 pages) and short (4 pages) papers, posters, and demonstrations, relating to any aspect of linguistic annotation, including:

(a) Annotation procedures:
     * Innovative automated and manual strategies for annotation
     * Machine learning and knowledge-based methods for automation of corpus annotation
     * Creation, maintenance, and interactive exploration of annotation structures and annotated data

(b) Annotation evaluation:
     * Inter-annotator agreement and other evaluation metrics and strategies
     * Qualitative evaluation of linguistic representation

(c) Annotation access and use:
     * Representation formats/structures for merged annotations of different phenomena, and means to explore/manipulate them
     * Linguistic considerations for merging annotations of distinct phenomena

(d) Annotation guidelines and standards:
     * Best practices for annotation procedures and/or development and documentation of annotation schemes
     * Interoperability of annotation formats and/or frameworks among different systems as well as different tasks, frameworks, modalities, and languages

(e) Annotation software and frameworks:
     * Development, evaluation and/or innovative use of annotation software frameworks

(f) Annotation schemes:
     * New and innovative annotation schemes
     * Comparison of annotation schemes

Workshop Theme
--------------
We encourage submission of papers relating to this year's theme, Interoperability with Discourse. We are particularly interested in the comparison and interoperability of different models and techniques used for and in conjunction with discourse annotation, focusing on any of the following goals:

(a) Creation of new insights within the field of discourse (by juxtaposing two or more points of view as reflected by different annotation schemes or annotation techniques).

(b) Fostering interoperability between pragmatic and semantic phenomena in discourse, ranging from functional categories (e.g. methods, results, hypotheses,etc.) to traditional discourse relations (connectives, anaphora, metonymies, etc.)

(c) Connecting syntactic, semantic and pragmatic layers of annotation.

(d) Working towards a framework, representation standards, tools and methods that will allow the integration and co-existence of current and future discourse-related annotation schemes.

Workshop Challenge
------------------
This year's workshop continues the tradition of the LAW Challenge, established last year, which provides funding for travel etc. to the individual or team that best meets a set of criteria. This year, the judges will give special consideration to papers closely related to the workshop theme, i.e., (1) integrating functional discourse annotation from one or more corpora with other types of annotation; and (2) demonstrating how interoperability can increase the understanding of the discourse. However, all papers addressing annotation interoperability or integration will be considered. For further information, please visit <A HREF="http://nactem.ac.uk/law7-id/.">http://nactem.ac.uk/law7-id/.</A>

Submission Information
----------------------
The papers should report original and unpublished research on topics of interest for the workshop. Accepted papers are expected to be presented at the workshop, and will be published in the workshop proceedings. They should emphasize obtained results rather than intended work, and should indicate clearly the state of completion of the reported results.

A paper accepted for presentation at the workshop must not be presented or have been presented at any other meeting with publicly available proceedings.

Submissions must be in PDF and formatted using the ACL 2013 style files, available at <A HREF="http://www.linguistics.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/law7-id/.">http://www.linguistics.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/law7-id/.</A>

The maximum length is eight (8) pages of content for long papers or four (4) pages of content for short papers, posters, and demonstrations, plus up to two (2) pages of references.

Reviewing of papers will be double-blind. Therefore, the paper must not include the authors' names and affiliations, and self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g., &quot;We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...&quot; should be replaced with citations such as &quot;Smith (1991) previously showed ...&quot;. Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.

Authors of papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or publications must provide this information on the START online submission page. Authors of accepted papers must notify the program chairs within 10 days of acceptance if the paper is withdrawn for any reason.

Submission site: <A HREF="https://www.softconf.com/acl2013/LAWVII-ID/.">https://www.softconf.com/acl2013/LAWVII-ID/.</A>

Submission deadline: 3 May 2013, 23:59 GMT (papers); 10 May 2013, 23:59 GMT (shared task). Papers submitted after the deadline will not be reviewed.
