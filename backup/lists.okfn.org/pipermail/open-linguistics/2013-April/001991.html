<PRE>Apologies for multiple posting

Job offer: Experienced researcher/product manager in data management
iSOCO Lab, Intelligent Software Components S.A., Madrid, Spain
<A HREF="http://www.isoco.com">http://www.isoco.com</A>

Knowledge Driven Data Exploitation (K-Drive) is a European Commission 
7th Framework Programme project for Industry-Academia Partnerships and 
Pathways. The main goals of K-Drive are (1) the development of efficient 
and scalable query generation techniques with potential for dealing with 
streaming data and knowledge and (2) the investigation of methods and 
techniques for goal-driven data selection and reuse for exploiting both 
public data and private data. The project studies the future perspective 
of using such novel data analysis techniques as diagnostic and guidance 
tools for domain experts and end users.

The R&amp;D Laboratory of Intelligent Software Components S.A (iSOCO Lab) is 
in charge of the development of efficient and scalable data analysis and 
access technologies, intelligent user interfaces and case studies. To 
accomplish these tasks, novel techniques for the encapsulation of large 
volumes of data and information access technologies need to be 
researched and implemented. To this purpose, iSOCO is looking for a 
highly competent and experienced individual with the twofold objective 
of (1) helping to undertake the above activities and (2) leading the 
process of taking these developments to the market by incorporating them 
into our product SEMANTI-K (<A HREF="http://www.isoco.com/soluciones/semantica">http://www.isoco.com/soluciones/semantica</A>).

As a candidate, you should have a strong background in Computer Science 
i.e., a PhD in Computer Science or Artificial Intelligence or equivalent 
experience, alongside a thorough understanding of linked data and 
semantic technologies. Publications on these topics in top conferences 
will be highly desirable. Extensive experience in innovative software 
development and management of software projects is a must. Skills in 
data mining, machine learning and distributed computation are welcome. 
Equally relevant will be technology transfer and industrial experience.

The Marie Curie Industry-Academia Partnerships and Pathways (IAPP) 
programme paves the way for individuals to bridge the gap between 
research and the market. As such, we offer researchers the possibility 
of starting a career in industry, transforming their research into 
innovation and economic value. Please note that it is a stipulation of 
the funding body that applicants have NOT lived, worked or studied in 
Spain for more than 12 months in the past three years. Additionally, the 
funding body stipulates that candidates must demonstrate 4-10 years of 
experience in research.

This post is funded from the K-Drive project and will be offered for a 
period of 2 years with the possibility of acquiring a permanent position 
at the end of such period. Informal inquiries and application submission 
may be made to our hhrr. dpt. at <A HREF="https://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-linguistics">hhrr at isoco.com.</A> The closing date for 
the receipt of applications is 15th May 2013.

Best

Boris
