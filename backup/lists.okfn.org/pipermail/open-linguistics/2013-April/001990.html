<PRE>Dear colleagues,



please find the call for papers for the Second Workshop on Linked Data in  
Linguistics below. Apologies for cross-posting!



Call for Papers
2nd Workshop on Linked Data in Linguistics (LDL-2013):
Representing and linking lexicons, terminologies and other language data

September 23rd 2013, Pisa, Italy

Collocated with the 6th Conference on Generative Approaches to the Lexicon  
(GL2013)

  The explosion of information technology has led to a substantial growth  
in quantity, diversity and complexity of linguistic data accessible over  
the internet. The lack of interoperability between linguistic and language  
resources represents a major challenge that needs to be addressed, in  
particular, if information from different sources is to be combined, like,  
say, machine-readable lexicons, corpus data and terminology repositories.  
For these types of resources, domain-specific standards have been  
proposed, yet, issues of interoperability between different types of  
resources persist, commonly accepted strategies to distribute, access and  
integrate their information have yet to be established, and technologies  
and infrastructures to address both aspects are still under development.

The goal of the workshop is to assemble researchers from various fields of  
linguistics, natural language processing, and information technology to  
present and discuss principles, case studies, and best practices for  
representing, publishing and linking linguistic data collections,  
including corpora, dictionaries, lexical networks, translation memories,  
thesauri, etc., infrastructures developed on that basis, their use of  
existing standards, and the publication and distribution policies that  
were adopted.

We particularly invite contributions discussing the application of the  
Linked Open Data paradigm to linguistic data as it might provide an  
important step towards making linguistic data: i) easily and uniformly  
queryable, ii) interoperable and iii) sharable over the Web using open  
standards such as the HTTP protocol and the RDF data model [1]. Recent  
research in this direction has lead to the emergence of a Linked Open Data  
cloud of linguistic resources, the Linguistic Linked Open Data (LLOD)  
cloud, where Linked Data principles were applied to language resources,  
allowing them to be published and linked in a principled way [2]. Although  
not restricted to lexical resources, these play a particularly prominent  
role in this context [3].

The intended audience includes computational linguists and NLP engineers  
interested in the application of Semantic Web formalisms and related  
technologies to language data, empirically-working linguists and  
lexicographers interested in the representation, exchange and interlinking  
of linguistic data and metadata, and developers of infrastructures for  
linguistic data and other researchers with an interest in both aspects.
Background and History

LDL-2013 is organized in the context of two recent community efforts, the  
Open Linguistics Working Group of the Open Knowledge Foundation (OWLG),  
and the W3C Ontology-Lexica Community Group. The Open Linguistics Working  
Group has spearheaded the creation of new data and the republishing of  
existing linguistic resources as linked open data. Similarly, the W3C  
Ontology-Lexica Community Group is seeking to develop standard models for  
representing and publishing (ontology-) lexica and other lexical resources  
as RDF.

The workshop is continuing a series of workshops on the application of the  
Linked Data paradigm to linguistic data that have been initiated and  
organized by the Open Linguistics Working Group: The First Workshop on  
Linked Data in Linguistics (LDL-2012) was conducted in March 2012 at the  
University of Frankfurt am Main/Germany, and collocated with the 34th  
Annual Meeting of the German Linguistics Society (DGfS-2012). The Workshop  
on Multilingual Linked Open Data for Enterprises (MLODE-2012) was  
conducted in September 2012 at the University of Leipzig/Germany, and  
collocated with the 3rd Conference on Software Agents and Services for  
Business, Research and E-Science (SABRE-2012). We intend to continue both  
series of workshops, with LDL workshops being attached to (computational)  
linguistic venues, and MLODE workshops co-located with information  
technology events.



Topics of Interest

We invite contributions related (but not limited) to the following topics:

1. Use cases and project proposals for the creation, maintenance and  
publication of linguistic data collections that are linked with other  
resources

2. Modelling linguistic data and metadata with OWL and/or RDF

3. Ontologies for linguistic data and metadata collections

4. Applications of such data, other ontologies or linked data from any  
subdiscipline of linguistics (may include work in progress or project  
descriptions)

5. Descriptions of data sets, ideally following Linked Data principles

6. Legal and social aspects of Linguistic Linked Open Data

Submission &amp; Publication

We accept submission of both long (up to 8 pages plus 2 pages for  
references) and short papers (up to 4 pages plus 2 pages for references)  
to be presented as long or short oral presentation at the workshop. The  
papers of the workshop will be published as CEUR proceedings. In addition,  
we aim for a journal special issue as post-conference proceedings in which  
a selected amount of papers presented at the workshop will be published.
