=======================
NLP &amp; DBpedia Workshop 2013
=======================
Free, open, interoperable and multilingual NLP for DBpedia and DBpedia 
for NLP:
<A HREF="http://nlp-dbpedia2013.blogs.aksw.org/">http://nlp-dbpedia2013.blogs.aksw.org/</A>

Collocated with the International Semantic Web Conference 2013 (ISWC 2013)
21-22 October 2013, in Sydney, Australia (*Submission deadline July 8th*)
**********************************

Recently, the DBpedia community has experienced an immense increase in 
activity and we believe, that the time has come to explore the 
connection between DBpedia &amp; Natural Language Processing (NLP) in a yet 
unpreceded depth. The goal of this workshop can be summarized by this 
(pseudo-) formula:

NLP &amp; DBpedia == DBpedia4NLP &amp;&amp; NLP4DBpedia
<A HREF="http://db0.aksw.org/downloads/CodeCogsEqn_bold2.gif">http://db0.aksw.org/downloads/CodeCogsEqn_bold2.gif</A>

DBpedia has a long-standing tradition to provide useful data as well as 
a commitment to reliable Semantic Web technologies and living best 
practices. With the rise of WikiData, DBpedia is step-by-step relieved 
from the tedious extraction of data from Wikipedia's infoboxes and can 
shift its focus on new challenges such as extracting information from 
the unstructured article text as well as becoming a testing ground for 
multilingual NLP methods.

Contribution
=========
Within the timeframe of this workshop, we hope to mobilize a community 
of stakeholders from the Semantic Web area.  We envision the workshop to 
produce the following items:
*   an open call to the DBpedia data consumer community will generate a 
wish list of data, which is to be generated from Wikipedia by NLP 
methods. This wish list will be broken down to tasks and benchmarks and 
a GOLD standard will be created.
*  the benchmarks and test data created will be collected and published 
under an open license for future evaluation (inspired by OAEI and 
UCI-ML).  An overview of the benchmarks can be found here: 
<A HREF="http://nlp-dbpedia2013.blogs.aksw.org/benchmarks">http://nlp-dbpedia2013.blogs.aksw.org/benchmarks</A>

Please sign up to our mailing list, if you are interested in discussing 
guidelines and NLP benchmarking: 
<A HREF="http://lists.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/mailman/listinfo/nlp-dbpedia-public">http://lists.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/mailman/listinfo/nlp-dbpedia-public</A>

Important dates
===========
8 July 2013, Paper Submission Deadline
9 August 2013, Notification of accepted papers sent to authors

Motivation
=======
The central role of Wikipedia (and therefore DBpedia) for the creation 
of a Translingual Web has recently been recognized by the Strategic 
Research Agenda (cf. section 3.4, page 23) and most of the contributions 
of the recently held Dagstuhl seminar on the Multilingual Semantic Web 
also stress the role of Wikipedia for Multilingualism. As more and more 
language-specific chapters of DBpedia appear (currently 14 language 
editions), DBpedia is becoming a driving factor for a Linguistic Linked 
Open Data cloud as well as localized LOD clouds with specialized domains 
(e.g. the Dutch windmill domain ontology created from 
<A HREF="http://nl.dbpedia.org">http://nl.dbpedia.org</A> ).

The data contained in Wikipedia and DBpedia have ideal properties for 
making them a controlled testbed for NLP. Wikipedia and DBpedia are 
multilingual and multi-domain, the communities maintaining these 
resource are very open and it is easy to join and contribute. The open 
license allows data consumers to benefit from the content and many parts 
are collaboratively editable.  Especially, the data in DBpedia is widely 
used and disseminated throughout the Semantic Web.

NLP4DBpedia
==========
DBpedia has been around for quite a while, infusing the Web of Data with 
multi-domain data of decent quality. These triples are, however, mostly 
extracted from Wikipedia infoboxes. To unlock the full potential of 
Wikipedia articles for DBpedia, the information contained in the 
remaining part of the articles needs to be analysed and triplified. 
Here, the NLP techniques may be of favour.

DBpedia4NLP
==========
On the other hand NLP, and information extraction techniques in 
particular, involve various resources while processing texts from 
various domains. These resources may be used e.g. as an element of a 
solution e.g. gazetteer being an important part of a rule created by an 
expert or disambiguation resource, or while delivering a solution e.g. 
within machine learning approaches. DBpedia easily fits in both of these 
roles.

We invite papers from both these areas including:
1. Knowledge extraction from text and HTML documents (especially 
unstructured and semi-structured documents) on the Web, using 
information in the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud, and especially in DBpedia.
2. Representation of NLP tool output and NLP resources as RDF/OWL, and 
linking the extracted output to the LOD cloud.
3. Novel applications using the extracted knowledge, the Web of Data or 
NLP DBpedia-based methods.

The specific topics are listed below.

Topics
=====
- Improving DBpedia with NLP methods
- Finding errors in DBpedia with NLP methods
- Annotation methods for Wikipedia articles
- Cross-lingual data and text mining on Wikipedia
- Pattern and semantic analysis of natural language, reading the Web, 
learning by reading
- Large-scale information extraction
- Entity resolution and automatic discovery of Named Entities
- Multilingual entity recognition task of real world entities
- Frequent pattern analysis of entities
- Relationship extraction, slot filling
- Entity linking, Named Entity disambiguation, cross-document 
co-reference resolution
- Disambiguation through knowledge base
- Ontology representation of natural language text
- Analysis of ontology models for natural language text
- Learning and refinement of ontologies
- Natural language taxonomies modeled to Semantic Web ontologies
- Use cases for potential data extracted from Wikipedia articles
- Use cases of entity recognition for Linked Data applications
- Impact of entity linking on information retrieval, semantic search

Furthermore, an informal list of NLP tasks can be found on this 
Wikipedia page: 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing#Major_tasks_in_NLP">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing#Major_tasks_in_NLP</A>
These are relevant for the workshop as long as they fit into the 
DBpedia4NLP  and NLP4DBpedia frame (i.e. the used data evolves around 
Wikipedia and DBpedia).

Submission formats
==============

Paper submission
-----------------------
All papers must represent original and unpublished work that is not 
currently under review. Papers will be evaluated according to their 
significance, originality, technical content, style, clarity, and 
relevance to the workshop. At least one author of each accepted paper is 
expected to attend the workshop.

* Full research paper  (up to 12 pages)
* Position papers (up to 6 pages)
* Use case descriptions (up to 6 pages)
* Data/benchmark paper (2-6 pages, depending on the size and complexity)

Note: data and benchmarks papers are meant to provide a citable 
reference for your data and benchmarks. We kindly require, that you 
upload any data you use to our benchmark repository in parallel to the 
submission. We recommend to use an open license (e.g. CC-BY), but 
minimum requirement is free use. Please write to the mailing list, if 
you have any problems.

Full instructions are available at: 
<A HREF="http://nlp-dbpedia2013.blogs.aksw.org/submission/">http://nlp-dbpedia2013.blogs.aksw.org/submission/</A>

Submission of data and use cases
--------------------------------------------
This workshop also targets non-academic users and developers. If you 
have any (open) data (e.g. texts or annotations) that can be used for 
benchmarking NLP tools, but do not want or needd to write an academic 
paper about it, please feel free to just add it to this table: 
<A HREF="http://tinyurl.com/nlp-benchmarks">http://tinyurl.com/nlp-benchmarks</A> or upload it to our repository:
