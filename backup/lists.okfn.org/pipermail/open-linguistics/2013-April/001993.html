LISC2013 - First Call for Papers

3rd International Workshop on Linked Science 2013&#8212;Supporting  Reproducibility, Scientific Investigations and Experiments (LISC2013)

October 21st or 22nd, 2013
Sydney, Australia
Collocated with the 12th International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC2013).

Submission Deadline: July 10th, 2013
Notification of Acceptance: August 9th, 2013

Contact: <A HREF="https://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-linguistics">lisc2013 at easychair.org</A>&lt;mailto:<A HREF="https://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-linguistics">lisc2013 at easychair.org</A>&gt;


*Objectives*
Scientific communication has a long history of relying heavily upon publications and presentations, producing an estimate of millions of publications worldwide per year. The results described in these articles are often backed by large amounts of diverse data produced by complex experiments, computer simulations, and observations of physical phenomena. Because of this avalanche of data, it is increasingly hard to validate, reproduce, reuse and leverage scientific findings. In addition, although publications, methods and datasets are very related, they are not equally accessible nor seamlessly interlinked. One notable exception is molecular biology research where journals require deposit of sequences in data banks as a condition of publication. Even where data is discoverable and accessible, significant challenges remain in data reuse and sharing, in facilitating the necessary correlation, integration and synthesis of data across levels of theory, techniques and disciplines.

In the 3rd International Workshop on Linked Science (LISC2013) we aim to discuss and present results of new ways of applying Semantic Web technologies to the publishing, sharing and interlinking of scientific data and methods, and to the reasoning over such resources to discover interesting new links to validate, reuse and reproduce scientific research. The theme of this year&#8217;s workshop is &#8220;Supporting  Reproducibility, Scientific Investigations and Experiments&#8221;. We will focus on scientific investigations and experiments that use Linked Data and semantic technologies to represent their data and methods and enable their knowledge discovery, reuse and validation.

LISC2013 will be a mixture of paper and demo presentations and break-out sessions. Workshop participants will also be expected to contribute informally to discussions as well as bring up their own topics of interest. LISC2013 is a continuation of the 1st International Workshop on Linked Science 2011 (LISC2011) and 2nd International Workshop on Linked Science 2012 (LISC2012).

*Submissions*
We invite two kinds of submissions:
-  Research papers. These should not exceed 12 pages in length.
-  Position papers. Novel ideas, experiments, and application visions from multiple disciplines and viewpoints are a key ingredient of the workshop. We therefore strongly encourage the submission of position papers. Position papers  should not exceed 4 pages in length.

The research papers can include optional tutorial materials that explain scientific studies that were made possible by Linked Data technologies. Accepted papers will be published at CEUR workshop series and supplementary tutorials will be published online atLinkedScience.org/tutorials&lt;<A HREF="http://atLinkedScience.org/tutorials">http://atLinkedScience.org/tutorials</A>&gt; and linked to the according workshop paper.

Submissions should be formatted according to the Lecture Notes in Computer Science guidelines for proceedings available at <A HREF="http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-7-72376-0">http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-7-72376-0</A> and submitted to <A HREF="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lisc2013.">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lisc2013.</A> Papers should be submitted in PDF format. The optional tutorial materials are submitted as a zip (preferably Wordpress friendly html including all figures).

At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the workshop. All workshop participants have to register for the main conference, ISWC2013, as well.

*Topics of Interest*
In all three categories, the submissions are expected in (but not restricted to) the following topics:
-  Linked Data- based scientific experiments
-  Dissemination and integration of scientific resources (data, methods, etc) using the Semantic Web
-  Linked Citizen Science
-  Scientific Information Retrieval
-  Formal representations of scientific data
-  Ontologies for scientific information
-  Reasoning mechanisms for interlinking scientific datasets and other resources
-  Integration of quantitative and qualitative scientific information
-  Ontology-based visualization of scientific data
-  Semantic similarity in science applications
-  Semantic integration of crowd sourced scientific data
-  Provenance, quality, privacy and trust of scientific information
-  Support for data publishing for sharing and reuse
-  Case studies on linked science, i.e., astronomy, biology, environmental and socio-economic impacts of global warming, statistics, environmental monitoring, cultural heritage, etc.
-  Replication of Semantic Web experiments
-  Reproduction of Semantic Web approaches &amp; results
-  Incentives for reproducing work by others &amp; making own work reproducible
-  Use of Semantic Web technology to support replication &amp; reproduction

*Proceedings*
The Workshop Proceedings will be published online.
