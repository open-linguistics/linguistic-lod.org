<PRE>2nd Call for Participation to the 15th Discovery Challenge - Recommending
Given Names


organized in conjunction with ECML PKDD 2013
September 23rd to 27th, 2013, Prague, Czech Republic


All over the world, future parents are facing the task of finding suitable
given names for their children. This choice is influenced by different
factors, such as the social context, language, cultural background and
especially personal taste. Typically, parents spent hours with browsing
through endless lists of names, hoping to find the perfect name.


LET&#146;S HELP THEM!


===============================================
2nd ANNOUNCEMENT: 20DC13 CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
===============================================


This year&#146;s ECML PKDD Discovery Challenge addresses the task of recommending
given names, that is, creating a recommender system for first names. Given a
set of names for which a user has shown interest in, the recommender should
provide suggestions for further names. The challenge is based on actual
usage data of the name search platform nameling (<A HREF="http://nameling.net">http://nameling.net</A>), which
attracted more than 60,000 users within less than a year.


The task of recommending names is new and thus many approaches have the
potential to yield a successful contribution. Teams of any size and
background (researchers, students, etc.) are welcome alike and we are very
much looking forward to your contribution and seeing you at the 20DC13
workshop!


The challenge consists of two parts, an offline and an online challenge. In
the offline challenge, participants develop a recommender that, given a set
of names for which a user has shown interest in, provides as list of
recommendations for that user. To win the offline challenge it is not
mandatory to take part in the online challenge although all participants are
welcome to integrate their recommender algorithms into the live system.


For detailed information regarding participation, task description and
access to the data please check the official 20DC13-Callenge-Website:
<A HREF="http://www.kde.cs.uni-kassel.de/ws/dc13.">http://www.kde.cs.uni-kassel.de/ws/dc13.</A>


The registration is open! First results can be compared on the leaderboard
on the challenge website.


====================================================================
IMPORTANT DEADLINES &amp; DATES:
- Deadline for results of the offline challenge: July 1st, 2013

- Start of the online challenge: July 15th, 2013

(<A HREF="http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs/lncs+authors">http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs/lncs+authors</A>) and must not exceed 12
pages including references and figures.
Papers must be submitted via EasyChair
(<A HREF="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=20dc13">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=20dc13</A>). The submissions to the
workshop are elicited through an open call for papers and will undergo peer
review by the program committee.
