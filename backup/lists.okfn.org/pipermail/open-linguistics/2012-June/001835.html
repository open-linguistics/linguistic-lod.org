<PRE>Dear group,
please find below a message by Laura. It is suggested that we have a look  
at the description of our group on the webpage, and that we collect ideas  
about a possible logo. Any ideas?
Best wishes

Hi Sebastian [H],

How are you doing?

I just wanted to check in about the progress of Open Linguistics.

Open Linguistics seems to be going strong, which is really great to see.
The mailing list is pretty active and the website's looking smart. Great
stuff! :)

Within the OKFN, we have also just adapted our central working groups page
(see <A HREF="http://okfn.org/wg/">http://okfn.org/wg/</A>) to direct people more clearly towards
interesting working groups. Your one sentence description currently says:

'Promote the idea and definition of open data in Linguistics and in
relation to language data.'

The length is about right, but I wonder if we could make the group sound
more engaging! If you need a hand let me know and I can try to help you
come up with something :)

Also, we have been thinking of getting a logo for each working group. Have
you considered this before, and if so, do you have anything in mind? If
you wanted, our designer Sam Smith would be happy to help you come up with
something.

The Linguistics group seems to be really proactive at the moment which is
fantastic. I just wanted to say a big thank you for all the work you put
in!

Cheers,
Laura
