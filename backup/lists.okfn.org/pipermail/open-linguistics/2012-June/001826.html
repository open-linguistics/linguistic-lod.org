<PRE>It is important to keep these two issues separate.  The issue of misuse would require me to get into detailed scenarios, and I would rather delay that discussion until I could think through the details, consult with others, and so on.  However, the issue of non-collaboration is much easier to define.  The concern here is that commercial interests benefit from academic research and the cooperativeness of the participants in the interaction without providing anything back.  I think this is an extremely clear and well defined concern and perhaps it is best to focus on that issue first.

If one can believe that the companies involved are themselves doing science, then most of that worry vanishes.  So, again, this is not about feeling bad that people are making money.  It is about hoping that they are willing to act as scientists and collaborators.

</I>&gt;<i> I don't know the nature of the problems of misrepresentations you cited in an earlier note, but it is not clear to me what you think a commercial user could do to your data that would violate the contributors' assumptions. Short of re-publishing the data as their own, it seems the most likely uses in any context are for internal research (which might lead to a product), or creation of derivative works such as lexicons that may be used in a product. Neither of these scenarios seems out of the range of things you might have originally had in mind (or am I wrong?), so what activities would be beyond what you could accept?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I guess I am trying to get you to identify specifically what you fear will happen if you eliminate NC and/or SA. That would help all of us to get a better idea of what the actual stakes are with these various licenses, which I think in many cases is rather vague in people's minds.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Let me chime in here and ask why you insist on SA vs. just CC-BY? Share-alike can be problematic for some (granted, mainly commercial users), so if you would be willing to eliminate the NC restriction, why continue to stick to SA?
