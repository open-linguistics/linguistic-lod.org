Massimo Poesio, University of Essex 
 
 - Title - 
Phrase Detectives: the First Three Years 
 
 - Abstract -
Phrase Detectives, one of the first games-with-a-purpose for corpus 
annotation (www.phrasedetectives.org) went officially online on December 
1st 2008, and one of its very first presentations in front of an NLP 
audience took place at the first edition of the &quot;People's Web Meets 
NLP&quot; workshop in Singapore in 2009. The option of annotating Italian 
documents was added in 2010, and a Facebook version went live in January 
2012. Although the project that funded its creation ended in September 
2009, the game has stayed very much alive, in fact it is getting more 
active all the time - we recently passed the 11,000 players mark and are 
about to reach 200,000 words of fully annotated documents, with a goal of 
annotating at least 1 million. In the talk I will discuss recent 
developments and analyze the results so far in terms of quality and 
quantity of annotated data and annotation costs.
