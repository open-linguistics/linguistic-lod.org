Subject: [Corpora-List] CALL FOR PAPERS - TAL Special Issue on Free  
Language Resources
Date: Fri, 03 Jun 2011 15:32:05 +0200

CALL FOR PAPERS
Special Issue of the TAL (Traitement Automatique des Langues / Natural
Language Processing) Journal on

FREE LANGUAGE RESOURCES

ATALA (French Association for Natural Language Processing) invites authors
to submit papers for the Special Issue on &quot;Free Language Resources&quot;.

Latest developments and applications in the field of Natural Language
Processing have significantly changed the paradigms for the design,
construction, operation and evaluation of, the so called, Language
Resources. In particular, the growing importance of empirical approaches
has
raised the demand of corpora and lexica as major sources of data on
languages. An increasingly important number of languages, including French
and other Romance languages, are gradually becoming equipped with new and
richer resources.

Language Resources can be textual, oral or multimodal. They include:
- written or oral corpora, raw or, more interestingly, enriched with
annotations of several kinds, which can range from morphosyntactic labels
to
prosodic information, from dependence graphs to discourse structure markup.
- lexical resources with information about one or more levels of linguistic
analysis, and also grammars or other forms of modeling different types of
language structures - the boundary between lexicon and grammar depends
often
on the approach (cf. TAG, lexicon-grammar, etc.).
- complex resources, combining an annotated corpus and an associated
lexical
database or combining information from different levels of linguistic
analysis.
A language resource may involve one or more variants of the language or
languages covered: standard language, the language of journalism,
specialized language (often with great importance given to issues of
terminology), oral language (if transcribed), blogs and forums, SMS, etc..

However, the development of language resources is a long, expensive and
highly error prone task regardless of the approaches used. This is one of
the reasons for the increasing importance of resources which are freely
available, so that authors and owners, while keeping the authorship, allow
for their exploitation, transformation and redistribution.

The goal of this special issue is to focus on the full range of scientific
issues related to language resources that go beyond the description of the
resources by themselves. Thus, expected contributions can cover all topics
related to language resources, including:

- Modeling of the language data that constitute the resource (both
linguistically motivated formal frameworks, representation of linguistic
information in the form of structured and/or quantitative data, standards
for Language Resources ...)

- Methodologies for the development of Language Resources, either  by hand,
completely automatic or hybrid (semi-supervised techniques, interlingual
transfer methods, use of pre-annotation tools, validation / correction
interfaces, etc.), approaches promoting linguistic relevance while
minimizing the &quot;human cost&quot; are most welcome.

- Methods for validation and evaluation of language resources including
extrinsic evaluation within NLP systems and for experimental linguistic
purposes. Contributions must show how the use of language resources has
caused system performance improvements, better understanding of phenomenon
and/or  be a means to assess or improve these language resources.

Language Resources for French, or better multilingual resources or language
independent methods where French is one of the addressed languages, are the
main objective of this call. Works on resources for other Romance languages
are also relevant. In addition, contributions related to free resources
will
be particularly appreciated.

THE JOURNAL

TAL (Traitement Automatique des Langues / Natural Language Processing) is a
forty year old international journal published by ATALA (French
Associationfor Natural Language Processing) with the support of CNRS
(National Centre for Scientific Research). It has moved to an electronic
mode of publication, with printing on demand. This affects in no way its
reviewing and selection process.


PRACTICAL ISSUES

Authors intending to submit a paper are encouraged to contact the guest
editors of the issue: Beno&#238;t Sagot (INRIA Paris Rocquencourt),
benoit.sagot at inria.fr et N&#250;ria Bel(IULA, Universitat Pompeu Fabra,
Barcelona),
nuria.bel at upf.edu

Contributions (25 pages maximum, PDF format) must be sent by e-mail to the
addresses below : benoit.sagot at inria.fr and nuria.bel at upf.edu

Style sheets are available for download on the Web site of the journal
<A HREF="http://www.atala.org/English-style-files">http://www.atala.org/English-style-files</A>

The journal only publishes original contributions in French or in English.
