<PRE>Very interesting! I'd love to see more on this. To me it sounds like
an interesting addition to the linguistics workshop. What do others
think?

Perhaps it might also be worth writing this up into a post for
linguistics.okfn.org?

All the best,

Jonathan

&gt;<i> Hello,

</I>&gt;<i> Edinburgh. I'm very interested in Open Knowledge, and have been working for

</I>&gt;<i> their work.&#160;I've submitted a proposal to talk about this to the main
</I>&gt;<i> committee for the OKF, and they said they'd think about it, but I probably
</I>&gt;<i> need to make my abstract a bit more clear. So I've written up an abstract
</I>&gt;<i> here - any help with how I could word it better would be really appreciated,
</I>&gt;<i> as I haven't done many professional abstracts before. The details of my
</I>&gt;<i> internship are here. I'm working on it with my mentors as well.
</I>&gt;<i> How does this relate to Linguistics? Well, I've been thinking that a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> the workflow systems I've been looking at would work in the field of corpus
</I>&gt;<i> linguistics if we merely had open source databases online that we could look
</I>&gt;<i> at. I've thought of a few tentative uses already - data curation using
</I>&gt;<i> outsourced human components, supplementary data checking using WALS and
</I>&gt;<i> automated regexp searching, and particularly grabbing phonemic word lists
</I>&gt;<i> from offline. I'd like to talk about this at the Linguistics workshop, if
</I>&gt;<i> that'd be alright. It kind of depends on whether my rough abstract above is
</I>&gt;<i> accepted for a talk (it's a very late submission), because that decides
</I>&gt;<i> whether I can come or not, but if that happens, I would really love to get
</I>&gt;<i> feedback on my ideas for open source linguistics databases that could lead
</I>&gt;<i> to open source linguistic methodological workflows.
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think? Apologies if this is the wrong place for this email -
</I>&gt;<i> again, I'm new.
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Richard Littauer
