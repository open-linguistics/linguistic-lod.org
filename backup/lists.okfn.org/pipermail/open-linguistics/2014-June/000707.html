NEWS: The 2 best workshop papers will be nominated and invited to submit an extended version to Journal of Data Semantics!

*Objectives*
Traditionally scientific dissemination has been relying heavily on publications and presentations. The findings reported in these articles are often backed by large amounts of diverse data produced by complex experiments, computer simulations, and observations of physical phenomena.  Although publications, methods and datasets are often related, due to this avalanche of data it remains extremely hard to correlate, reuse and leverage scientific data.  Semantic Web technologies provide a promising means for publishing, sharing, and interlinking data to facilitate data reuse and the necessary correlation, integration, and synthesis of data across levels of theory, techniques and disciplines. However, even when these data become discoverable and accessible, significant challenges remain in making intelligent understandings of these data and scientific discoveries that we anticipated.

Our past three series have seen many novel ideas of using Semantic Web technologies for integrating scientific data (for example about real experiments or from simulations), or enabling reproducibility of research via online tools and Linked Data. The theme for LISC 2014 is &#8220;Making Sense out of Data Through Linked Science&#8221;. Here we focus on new ways of discovering interesting patterns from scientific data, which could lead to research validation or identification of new hypotheses and acceleration of the scientific research cycle. We encourage both new results through making use of semantic reasoning or making innovative combination of existing technologies (such as visualization, data mining, machine learning, and natural language processing) with SW technologies to enable better understanding of data. One goal is to create both an incentive for scientists to consider the Linked Science approach for their scientific data management and an incentive for technologists from different disciplines to work together towards the vision of powering science with technologies.

*Topics of Interest*
Topics for submissions include, but are not limited to:
&#9679;      Data profiling and quality profiling of Linked Science Data
&#9679;      Pattern discovery
&#9679;      Semantic query generation
&#9679;      (Semi-)Automatic hypothesis generation
&#9679;      Augmented human reasoning
&#9679;      Interactive semantic systems
&#9679;      Active discovery
&#9679;      Methodology for explorative empirical research on linked data
&#9679;      Citation generation
&#9679;      Reasoning mechanisms for linking scientific datasets
&#9679;      Integration of quantitative and qualitative scientific information
&#9679;      Novel visualization of scientific data
&#9679;      Scientific Information Retrieval
&#9679;      Linked Data-based scientific experiments
&#9679;      Integration of experimental data using Semantic Web
&#9679;      Linked Citizen Science
&#9679;      Formal representations of scientific data
&#9679;      Ontologies for scientific information
&#9679;      Semantic similarity in science applications
&#9679;      Semantic integration of crowd sourced scientific data
&#9679;      Provenance, quality, privacy and trust of scientific information
&#9679;      Support for data publishing for sharing and reuse
&#9679;      Sharing of experimental setups for replication and reproducibility studies
&#9679;      Case studies on linked science, i.e., astronomy, biology, environmental and socio- economic impacts of global warming, statistics, environmental monitoring, cultural heritage, etc.


*Submissions*
We invite two kinds of submissions:
- Research papers. These should not exceed 12 pages in length.
- Position papers. Novel ideas, experiments, and application visions from multiple disciplines and viewpoints are a key ingredient of the workshop. We therefore strongly encourage the submission of position papers. Position papers  should not exceed 4 pages in length.

We also offer a special track on &#8220;Intelligent Use of the EBI RDF Platform&#8221;. Officially launched in October 2013, the EBI RDF Platform provides SPARQL access to a suite of EMBL-EBI resources, covering data on genes and gene expression, proteins (with Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics), pathways, samples, biomodels and molecules with drug-like properties. As a world-leading bioinformatics research organization, the launch of EBI RDF Platforms marks a significant milestone in the adoption of SW technologies in the science domain. In this special track we are looking for innovative ideas which describe focused, use case driven applications and which use at least one of the EBI RDF services (<A HREF="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/rdf/services">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/rdf/services</A>). Submissions to this track should not exceed 4 pages in length and should make it clear:
- Which bits of the EBI RDF and any other data or technology were used
- The benefit of the submission to the end user who should be someone working in the life sciences, such as bench scientists, data scientists or bioinformaticians

The research papers can include optional tutorial materials that explain scientific studies that were made possible by Linked Data technologies. Accepted papers will be published at CEUR workshop series and supplementary tutorials will be published online at <A HREF="http://linkedscience.org/">http://linkedscience.org/</A> and linked to the according workshop paper.

Submissions should be formatted according to the Lecture Notes in Computer Science guidelines for proceedings available <A HREF="athttp://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-7-72376-0">athttp://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-7-72376-0</A> and submitted to <A HREF="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lisc2014.">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lisc2014.</A> Papers should be submitted in PDF format. The optional tutorial materials are submitted as a zip (preferably Wordpress friendly html including all figures).

At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the workshop. All workshop participants have to register for the main conference, ISWC2014, as well.

*Important Dates*
- submission date: 7 July, 2014, 23:59 Hawaii time
- author notifications: July 30, 2014, 23:59 Hawaii time
- camera-ready: August 20, 2014, 23:59 Hawaii time
