Motivation
The DBpedia community has recently experienced an immense increase in 
activity. We believe that the time has come to explore the connection 
between DBpedia &amp; Natural Language Processing (NLP) in a yet 
unprecedented depth.

DBpedia has a long-standing tradition to provide useful data as well as 
a commitment to reliable Semantic Web technologies and living best 
practices. With the rise of WikiData, DBpedia is step-by-step relieved 
from the tedious extraction of data from Wikipedia&#8217;s infoboxes and can 
shift its focus on new challenges such as extracting information from 
the unstructured article text as well as becoming a testing ground for 
multilingual NLP methods.

The central role of Wikipedia (and therefore DBpedia) for the creation 
of a Translingual Web has recently been recognized by the Strategic 
Research Agenda 
(<A HREF="http://www.meta-net.eu/vision/reports/meta-net-sra-version_1.0.pdf">http://www.meta-net.eu/vision/reports/meta-net-sra-version_1.0.pdf</A> cf. 
section 3.4, page 23) and most of the contributions of the recent 
Dagstuhl seminar on the Multilingual Semantic Web ( 
<A HREF="http://www.dagstuhl.de/de/programm/kalender/semhp/?semnr=12362">http://www.dagstuhl.de/de/programm/kalender/semhp/?semnr=12362</A>) also 
stress the role of Wikipedia for Multilingualism 
(<A HREF="http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2013/3788/pdf/dagrep_v002_i009_p015_s12362.pdf">http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2013/3788/pdf/dagrep_v002_i009_p015_s12362.pdf</A>). 
As more and more language-specific chapters of DBpedia are created 
(currently 14 language editions), DBpedia is becoming a driving factor 
for a Linguistic Linked Open Data cloud 
(<A HREF="http://linguistics.okfn.org/resources/llod/">http://linguistics.okfn.org/resources/llod/</A>) as well as localized LOD 
clouds with specialized domains (e.g. the Dutch windmill domain ontology 
created from <A HREF="http://nl.dbpedia.org">http://nl.dbpedia.org</A>).

The data contained in Wikipedia and DBpedia have ideal properties for 
making them a controlled testbed for NLP. Wikipedia and DBpedia are 
multilingual and multi-domain, the communities maintaining these 
resource are very open and it is easy to join and contribute. The open 
licence allows data consumers to benefit from the content and many parts 
are collaboratively editable. Especially, the data in DBpedia is widely 
used and disseminated throughout the Semantic Web.

We envision the workshop to produce the following items:
&#8226; an open call to the DBpedia data consumer community will generate a 
wish list of data, which is to be generated from Wikipedia by NLP 
methods. This wish list will be broken down to tasks and benchmarks, and 
a gold standard will be created.
&#8226; the benchmarks and test data created will be collected and published 
under an open licence for future evaluation (inspired by 
<A HREF="http://oaei.ontologymatching.org/">http://oaei.ontologymatching.org/</A> and 
<A HREF="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html">http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html</A>).

NLP4DBpedia
DBpedia has been around for quite a while, infusing the Web of Data with 
multi-domain data of decent quality. The data in DBpedia is, however, 
mostly extracted from Wikipedia infoboxes, while the remaining parts of 
Wikipedia are to a large extent not exploited for DBpedia. Here, NLP 
techniques may help improving DBpedia.

Extracting additional triples from the plain text information in 
Wikipedia, either unsupervised or using the existing triples as training 
information, could multiply the information in DBpedia, or help telling 
correct from incorrect information by finding supporting text passages. 
Furthermore, analyzing the semantics of other structures in Wikipedia, 
such as tables, list pages, or categories, would help make DBpedia 
richer. Finally, since Wikipedia exists in more than 200 languages, we 
are particularly interested in seeing NLP approaches not only working 
for English, but also for other languages, in order to leverage the huge 
amount of knowledge captured in the different language editions.

DBpedia4NLP
On the other hand, NLP and information extraction techniques often 
involve various resources while processing texts from different domains. 
As high-quality annotated data is often too expensive and time-consuming 
to obtain, NLP researchers are looking to external structured sources to 
complement their datasets. Such resources can be gazetteers to aid a 
named entity recognition system or examples of relations between 
entities to bootstrap a relation finder. DBpedia can easily be utilised 
to assist NLP modules in a variety of tasks.

We invite papers from both these areas including:
&#8226; Knowledge extraction from text and HTML documents (especially 
unstructured and semi-structured documents) on the Web, using 
information in the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud, and especially in DBpedia.
&#8226; Representation of NLP tool output and NLP resources as RDF/OWL, and 
linking the extracted output to the LOD cloud.
&#8226; Novel applications using the extracted knowledge, the Web of Data or 
NLP DBpedia-based methods.

Topics include, but are not limited to

&#8226; Improving DBpedia with NLP methods
&#8226; Finding errors in DBpedia with NLP methods
&#8226; Annotation methods for Wikipedia articles
&#8226; Cross-lingual data and text mining on Wikipedia
&#8226; Pattern and semantic analysis of natural language, reading the Web, 
learning by reading
&#8226; Large-scale information extraction
&#8226; Entity resolution and automatic discovery of Named Entities
&#8226; Multilingual entity recognition task of real world entities
&#8226; Frequent pattern analysis of entities
&#8226; Relationship extraction, slot filling
&#8226; Entity linking, Named Entity disambiguation, cross-document 
co-reference resolution
&#8226; Disambiguation through knowledge base
&#8226; Ontology representation of natural language text
&#8226; Analysis of ontology models for natural language text
&#8226; Learning and refinement of ontologies
&#8226; Natural language taxonomies modeled to Semantic Web ontologies
&#8226; Use cases of entity recognition for Linked Data applications
&#8226; Impact of entity linking on information retrieval, semantic search

Furthermore, an informal list of NLP tasks can be found on this 
Wikipedia page: 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing#Major_tasks_in_NLP">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing#Major_tasks_in_NLP</A>
These are relevant for the workshop as long as they fit into the 
DBpedia4NLP and NLP4DBpedia frame (i.e. the used data evolves around 
Wikipedia and DBpedia).
Workshop format
The workshop will be pro-active to encourage collaborative 
participation: for example, live minutes of the workshop will be taken 
using an open EtherPad. We plan to collect the material used by each 
submission such as dataset used, source code, etc. and to share it to 
the whole community using a portal such as CKAN. Moreover, we intend to 
give to the attendees a big picture from the workshop day and to mainly 
discuss and fill the topics highlighted in the Knowledge Extraction 
Wikipedia page. Participants are also encouraged to extend the Wikipedia 
page.


Submissions
All papers must represent original and unpublished work that is not 
currently under review. Papers will be evaluated according to their 
significance, originality, technical content, style, clarity, and 
relevance to the workshop. At least one author of each accepted paper is 
expected to attend the workshop. Accepted papers will be published 
through CEUR-WS.

We welcome the following types of contributions:

&#8226; Full research papers (up to 12 pages).
&#8226; Position papers (up to 6 pages)
&#8226; Use case descriptions (up to 6 pages)
&#8226; Data/benchmark papers (2-6 pages, depending on the size and complexity)
