<PRE>International Semantic Web in Practice Workshop (SWiP'14):
(with SKG'14) || August 25-29, 2014, Beijing, China


Overview:
----------------------
Since the vision of Semantic Web was proposed in 2001, it has attracted huge attention from both academic and industrial communities. After a decade of development, the theoretical research and tool support have achieved many exciting results.

Despite the success, the industrial uptake of semantic technologies is slower than people had expected.

Collocated with The 10th International Conference on Semantics, Knowledge &amp; Grids (SKG'14), SWiP'14 is a one-day workshop that provides a venue to present and discuss benefits, limitations, challenges and solution for the adoption of semantic technologies in various application domains.

We are confident that SWiP'14 will provide an open and stimulating environment that brings together researchers, developers and users from various fields to discuss goals, real-world experiences and prospects of the use of Semantic Web technologies in practice.

Subject Areas:
----------------------
We invite contributions that concern the following areas (please keep in mind that this is not an exhaustive list):
*      Application of semantic technologies
*      Semantic Web tools and systems
*      Knowledge representation and reasoning
*      Query answering of semantic data
*      Generation and consumption of Linked Data
*      Semantic visualization
*      Semantic Web on the cloud
*      Semantic Web best practices
*      Semantic Web: limitation and future prospects

Submissions:
----------------------
The SWiP Workshop welcomes electronic submissions in pdf format only. Two types of submissions are accepted:
*      Abstracts of up to 2 pages can be submitted prior to the workshop. High quality accepted abstracts will be invited to submit full papers of up to 8 pages after the workshop.
*      Full papers of up to 8 pages and short papers of up to 4 pages can be submitted prior to the conference.
