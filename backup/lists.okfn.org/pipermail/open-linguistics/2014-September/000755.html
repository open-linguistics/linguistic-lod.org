************************
Overview

Since 2008, the SWAT4LS Workshop has provided a platform for the
presentation and discussion of the benefits and limits of applying web-based
information systems and semantic technologies in the domains of health care
and life sciences. SWAT4LS has been held in Edinburgh (2008), Amsterdam (2009), Berlin (2010), London (2011), Paris (2012) and Edinburgh (2013). 

The next edition of SWAT4LS will be held in Berlin, Germany, on December 9 - 11, 2014. It will be articulated in a tutorials day (9th), a main workshop day (10th) and an hackathon day (11th).

We are confident that the next edition of SWAT4LS will provide the same open
and stimulating environment that has previously brought together researchers,
developers, and users, from various fields including eHealth, biomedical and clinical informatics, radiation oncology, systems biology, computational biology, drug discovery, bioinformatics and biocomputing, to discuss goals, current limits and real experiences with Semantic Web and Linked Data technologies in health care and the life sciences.

________________________________________

Rationale

The Web is a key medium for information publishing, and Web-based information systems play a key role in biomedical information exchange and data integration. The Semantic Web in particular provides a set of interoperable standards and technologies that support knowledge representation, ontology development, machine reasoning, data mining, machine learning, distributed information resources, and collaborative research environments. 
The variety and complexity of biomedical information requires these kind of technologies and altogether, the adoption of the Web-based semantic technologies in health care and the life sciences is having an impact on publishing, as well as biological and clinical research. 
This workshop will provide a venue to present and discuss the benefits and limits of adoption of these technologies. It will showcase experiences, information resources, tool development and applications. It will bring together researchers, both developers and users, from biology, bioinformatics, computer science, and the clinic to discuss goals, current limits and use cases for Semantic Web technologies.
________________________________________

Topics

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Semantic interoperability of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and clinical trial data
- Connecting clinical practice and clinical research
- Rapid Learning infrastructures for health care
- Enabling translational medicine and personalized medicine
- Interactive Knowledge Browsing and Semantic Web approaches to Big Metadata
- Harnessing biomedical ontologies and terminologies with medical standards for information exchange
- Standards such as HL7, BRIDG, CDISC, DICOM, EN13606, ISO 18308, openEHR, together with medical terminologies and ontologies such as SNOMED, NCIt, LOINC, MedDRA, ICD, CTCAE, ATC for international Continuity of Care Record (CCR) and transmural care
- Clinical Decision Support Systems
- Methods for reusing patient data in clinical research
- Patient recruitment, eligibility studies, and OWL/RDF models of eligibility criteria 
- Semantic Web standards and new proposals (e.g.: RuleML, RDF, OWL, SKOS, SPIN, Microformats)
- Tools for ontology mapping, editing, annotation, versioning and provenance management
- APIs and Tools for access to (distributed) knowledge bases
(e.g.multi-agents, rest apis, semantic web services, OMG API4KB)
- Semantic Scientific Workflows and eScience processes
- RDF stores, NoSQL, reasoners, query and visualization systems
- Knowledge representation for biomedical knowledge bases
- Applications of query federation for distributed knowledge, data sharing, and data discovery
- Access control and data security for medical data
- Tools for semantics-enabled Web publication
