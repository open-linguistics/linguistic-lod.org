INTERNATIONAL WINTER SCHOOL ON BIG DATA

BigDat 2015

Tarragona, Spain

January 26-30, 2015

Organized by
Rovira i Virgili University

<A HREF="http://grammars.grlmc.com/bigdat2015/">http://grammars.grlmc.com/bigdat2015/</A>

*****************************************************

--- 4th registration deadline: September 23, 2014 ---

*****************************************************

AIM:

BigDat 2015 is a research training event for graduates and postgraduates in
the first steps of their academic career. It aims at updating them about the
most recent developments in the fast developing area of big data, which
covers a large spectrum of current exciting research, development and
innovation with an extraordinary potential for a huge impact on scientific
discoveries, medicine, engineering, business models, and society itself.
Renowned academics and industry pioneers will lecture and share their views
with the audience.

All big data subareas will be displayed, namely: foundations,
infrastructure, management, search and mining, security and privacy, and
applications. Main challenges of analytics, management and storage of big
data will be identified through 4 keynote lectures and 24 six-hour courses,
which will tackle the most lively and promising topics. The organizers
believe outstanding speakers will attract the brightest and most motivated
students. Interaction will be a main component of the event.

ADDRESSED TO:

Graduate and postgraduates from around the world. There are no formal
pre-requisites in terms of academic degrees. However, since there will be
differences in the course levels, specific knowledge background may be
required for some of them.

BigDat 2015 is also appropriate for more senior people who want to keep
themselves updated on recent developments and future trends. They will
surely find it fruitful to listen and discuss with major researchers,
industry leaders and innovators.

REGIME:

In addition to keynotes, 3 courses will run in parallel during the whole
event. Participants will be able to freely choose the courses they will be
willing to attend as well as to move from one to another.

VENUE:

<A HREF="http://grammars.grlmc.com/bigdat2015/registration.php">http://grammars.grlmc.com/bigdat2015/registration.php</A> 

The selection of up to 8 courses requested in the registration template is
only tentative and non-binding. For the sake of organization, it will be
helpful to have an approximation of the respective demand for each course.

Since the capacity of the venue is limited, registration requests will be
processed on a first come first served basis. The registration period will
be closed and the on-line registration facility disabled when the capacity
of the venue will be complete. It is much recommended to register prior to
the event.

As far as possible, participants are expected to stay full-time. Fees are a
flat rate covering the attendance to all courses during the week. There are
several early registration deadlines. Fees depend on the registration
deadline.
