Real-Time Computing covers a broad spectrum of the intensively 
developing area of low-latency priority-driven system responsiveness 
under certain time constrains to essential and decisive human-computer 
interactions with constantly incoming data stream. Research on real-time 
intelligent systems is of a multi-disciplinary nature, exploiting 
concepts from the areas as diverse as signal processing technologies, 
computational intelligence, location systems, data processing, digital 
document processing and embedded system design. To accomplish its 
real-time performance, systematic analysis is carried out when the 
systems are working.

Therefore, over the last few years real-time intelligent computing has 
radically transformed human life style. In the today's competitive and 
highly dynamic environment, analyzing data in real time is a must to 
understand in detail how the systems are processing the data and to 
reason the outputs and anticipate the trends in intelligent computing, 
has become critical. To leverage the full potential of the opportunity 
build complex real time systems, intense research is required and this 
conference will serve as one such platform to manifest the ongoing 
research in the real time intelligence system.
The conference welcomes theoretically grounded, methodologically sound 
research papers from academia and industry that address variety of 
aspects and innovations related to real-time computing systems.

The scope of the conference includes, but is not limited to the 
following areas:

Streaming data, streaming engines
Big Data systems and applications for high-velocity data
Analysis in advanced domains such as energy, sensors, etc
Artificial Intelligence
