This year, SEMANTiCS features a special Data Science track, which is an 
opportunity to bring together researchers and practitioners interested 
in data science and its intersection with Linked Data to present their 
ideas and discuss the most important scientific, technical and 
socio-economical challenges of this emerging field.

SEMANTiCS 2017 will especially welcome submissions for the following hot 
topics:
*Metadata, Versioning and Data Quality Management
*Semantics for Safety, Security &amp; Privacy
*Web Semantics, Linked (Open) Data &amp; schema.org
*Corporate Knowledge Graphs
*Knowledge Integration and Language Technologies
*Economics of Data, Data Services and Data Ecosystems

Special Track (please check appropriate topic in submission system)
*Data Science

Posters &amp; Demos Track

The Posters &amp; Demonstrations Track invites innovative work in progress, 
late-breaking research and innovation results, and smaller contributions 
in all fields related to the broadly understood Semantic Web. These 
include submissions on innovative applications with impact on end users 
such as demos of solutions that users may test or that are yet in the 
conceptual phase, but are worth discussing, and also applications, use 
cases or pieces of code that may attract developers and potential 
research or business partners. This also concerns new data sets made 
publicly available.

The informal setting of the Posters &amp; Demonstrations Track encourages 
participants to present innovations to the research community, business 
users and find new partners or clients and engage in discussions about 
the presented work. Such discussions can be invaluable inputs for the 
future work of the presenters, while offering conference participants an 
effective way to broaden their knowledge of the emerging research trends 
and to network with other researchers.

Poster and demo submissions should consist of a paper that describe the 
work, its contribution to the field or novelty aspects. Submissions must 
be original and must not have been submitted for publication elsewhere.

Accepted papers will be published in HTML (RASH) in CEUR and, as such, 
the camera-ready version of the papers will be required in HTML, 
following the poster and demo guidelines (<A HREF="https://goo.gl/3BEpV7">https://goo.gl/3BEpV7</A>). Papers 
should be submitted through EasyChair 
(<A HREF="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=semantics2017">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=semantics2017</A> and should be 
less than 2200 words in length (equivalent to 4 pages), including the 
whole content of the paper.

For the initial reviewing phase, authors may submit a PDF version of the 
paper following any layout. After acceptance, authors are required to 
submit the camera-ready in HTML (RASH).

Submissions will be reviewed by experienced and knowledgeable 
researchers and practitioners; each submission will receive detailed 
feedback. For demos, we encourage authors to include links enabling the 
reviewers to test the application or review the component.
