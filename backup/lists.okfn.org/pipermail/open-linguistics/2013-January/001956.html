Typology lives on data. Typologists produce, curate, extract, aggregate,
and analyze data on a daily basis. One major issue is the interoperability
of digital data thus gathered. This workshop will deal with the
production, publication, and interlinking of typological data according to
Semantic Web principles (Linked Open Data).

Several attempts at standardizing typological data have been made, e.g.
LDS (Comrie &amp; Smith 1977) and GOLD (Farrar and Langendoen 2003). These
top-down approaches have had some success, but a large scale adoption is
still wanting. A bottom-up approach as for instance employed by TDS
(<A HREF="http://tds2.dans.knaw.nl/">http://tds2.dans.knaw.nl/</A>) and ISO-CAT (<A HREF="http://www.isocat.org/">http://www.isocat.org/</A>) could be
more promising as it takes into account the often strong feelings
linguists have about data categories.

Numerous projects around the world gather heterogeneous typological data,
but data representation is by and large project-specific and not guided by
general principles. This often results in serious problems over time,
including issues with regard to persistence, provenance, interoperability,
and accessibility.

These problems are well-known in other data-heavy subdisciplines, e.g.
lexicography and corpus linguistics. The lemon project (McCrae et al.
2012) tackles these issues for lexicography, OLiA does the same for corpus
linguistics (Chiarcos 2012). In this workshop, we want to explore in how
far the solutions developed in the other subdisciplines can be applied to
typology, building upon more general concepts of interlinking
heterogeneous data sets in the context of Linked Open Data (Berners-Lee
2006, Heath &amp; Bizer 2009).

The working group on Open Data in Linguistics of the Open Knowledge
Foundation has recently started working on interlinking data from various
subdisciplines (Chiarcos et al. 2012a). The insights and experiences
gained there can fruitfully be applied to typology, as the integration of
WALS, WOLD, ASJP, Glottolog, and IDS into the Linguistic Linked Open Data
Cloud show (Nordhoff 2012, Hellmann et al. forthcoming). Chiarcos et al.
(2012b) show how such data can then be cross-queried across knowledge
bases to gain new insights and test hypotheses.

The major advantages of the Linked Open Data approach advocated in
Chiarcos et al. (2012a) are the potentials of cross-querying data, and the
possibility of a federated approach to data production (crowdsourcing).

The aim of this workshop is to bring together typologists who create or
curate large data sets and practitioners of Linked Open Data, to leverage
the potential of creating a linked data cloud for linguistic typology. We
welcome presentations about novel techniques of publishing data on the
web, about interlinking and cross-querying databases, and about federating
data production.
