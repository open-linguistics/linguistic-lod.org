*******************************************************


4th INTERNATIONAL WINTER SCHOOL ON BIG DATA


BigDat 2018


Timisoara, Romania


January 22-26, 2018


Organized by:

West University of Timisoara

Rovira i Virgili University


<A HREF="http://grammars.grlmc.com/BigDat2018/">http://grammars.grlmc.com/BigDat2018/</A>


*******************************************************


--- Early registration deadline: October 19, 2017 ---


*******************************************************


SCOPE:


BigDat 2018 will be a research training event with a global scope aiming at updating participants about the most recent advances in the critical and fast developing area of big data, which covers a large spectrum of current exciting research and industrial innovation with an extraordinary potential for a huge impact on scientific discoveries, medicine, engineering, business models, and society itself. Renowned academics and industry pioneers will lecture and share their views with the audience.


Most big data subareas will be displayed, namely foundations, infrastructure, management, search and mining, security and privacy, and applications (to biological and health sciences, to business, finance and transportation, to online social networks, etc.). Major challenges of analytics, management and storage of big data will be identified through 2 keynote lectures, 26 five hour and fifteen minute-courses, and 1 round table, which will tackle the most active and promising topics. The organizers are convinced that outstanding speakers will attract the brightest and most motivated students. Interaction will be a main component of the event.


An open session will give participants the opportunity to present their own work in progress in 5 minutes. Also, there will be two special sessions with industrial and recruitment profiles.


ADDRESSED TO:


Master students, PhD students, postdocs, and industry practitioners will be typical profiles of participants. However, there are no formal pre-requisites for attendance in terms of academic degrees. Since there will be a variety of levels, specific knowledge background may be assumed for some of the courses. Overall, BigDat 2018 is addressed to students, researchers and practitioners who want to keep themselves updated about recent developments and future trends. All will surely find it fruitful to listen and discuss with major researchers, industry leaders and innovators.


STRUCTURE:


3 courses will run in parallel during the whole event. Participants will be able to freely choose the courses they wish to attend as well as to move from one to another.


VENUE:


BigDat 2018 will take place in Timisoara, which has been nominated one of the European Capitals of Culture in 2021. The venue will be:


Universitatea de Vest

Blvd. Vasile Parv&#226;n, nr. 4

300223 Timisoara
