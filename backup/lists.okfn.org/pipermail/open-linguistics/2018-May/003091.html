CALL FOR PAPERS AIMSA 2018

The 18th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence: 
Methodology, Systems, Applications
          - AI and Deep Learning -

      Golden Sands resort, Varna, Bulgaria, 12-14th September, 2018
          www.aimsaconference.org


Initiated in 1984, the biennial Artificial Intelligence: Methodology, 
Systems, Applications (AIMSA) conference is a premier forum for 
exchanging information and research results on AI theory and principles 
along with applications of intelligent system technology. The conference 
traditionally brings together academic and industrial researchers from 
all areas of AI to share their ideas and experiences and learn about the 
research in contemporary AI. As its name indicates, the conference is 
dedicated to Artificial Intelligence in its entirety. However, for AIMSA 
2018, we would like to put an emphasis on Deep Learning (DL) as it has 
been used successfully in many applications, and is considered one of 
the most cutting-edge machine learning and AI techniques at the moment. 
Of course, the focus on DL does not preclude submission of papers on 
other interesting topics and approaches in AI.

The 18th edition of AIMSA will be held in the beautiful Varna area, 
Bulgaria. With excellent opportunities for outdoor activities, water 
sports and gastronomy, Varna promises to be a wonderful venue for a 
memorable conference.

TOPICS

The conference welcomes submissions of original, high quality papers in 
all areas of Artificial Intelligence, including (but not limited to) 
traditional topics such as search, machine learning, planning, knowledge 
representation, reasoning, natural language processing, robotics and 
perception, multiagent systems, etc.
We especially welcome papers on end-to-end learning; multi-task 
learning; cross- and multi-modal learning; combinations of DL and 
knowledge-based approaches; transparency, explainability, stability and 
provability of DL; DL meta-learning in AI etc., as well as papers that 
bring useful computational technologies from other areas of computer 
science into AI.

All submissions will be subject to academic peer review by at least two 
members of the program committee. Selection criteria include accuracy 
and originality of ideas, clarity and significance of results, and 
quality of presentation.

For each accepted paper, at least one author is required to attend the 
conference to present the paper.

The best paper of the conference will receive the Best Paper Award 
during the conference.
