(ICDIM 2018)
September 24-26, 2018
Berlin, Germany
<A HREF="http://www.icdim.org">http://www.icdim.org</A>
Technically Co-sponsored by IEEE Technology and Engineering Management 
Society

Following the successful earlier conferences at Bangalore (2006), Lyon 
(2007), London (2008), Michigan (2009) , Thunder Bay (2010), Melbourne 
(2011), Macau (2012), Islamabad (2013), Bangkok (2014) Jeju (2015) Porto 
(2016) and Fukuoka (2017), the Thirteenth event is being organized at 
Berlin, Germany in 2018. The International Conference on Digital 
Information Management is a multidisciplinary conference on digital 
information management, science and technology. The principal aim of 
this conference is to bring people in academia, research laboratories 
and industry together, and offer a collaborative platform to address the 
emerging issues and solutions in digital information science and 
technology.

Digital Information technologies are gaining maturity and rapid momentum 
in adoption across disciplines. The digital community is producing new 
ways of using digital information technologies for integrating and 
making sense out of various data ranging from real/live streams and 
simulations to analytics data analysis, in support of mining of 
knowledge. The conference will feature original research and industrial 
papers on the theory, design, and implementation of digital information 
systems, as well as demonstrations, tutorials, workshops and industrial 
presentations.
