*Call for Papers*

As the number of people and this interaction over the web has increased,
incidents of aggression and related activities like trolling,
cyberbullying, flaming, hate speech, etc. have also increased manifold
across the globe. The reach and extent of Internet has given such incidents
unprecedented power and influence to affect the lives of billions of
people. We are happy to announce that we are organising the First Workshop
on Trolling, Aggression and Cyberbullying at 27thInternational Conference
of Computational Linguistics (COLING &#8211; 2018) in New Mexico, USA on 20 / 21
August, 2018, focussing on these and other related phenomena, in both text
(especially social media) and speech.

We invite original and unpublished full papers for powerpoint and poster
presentations and demo of working systems around the following themes:

Theories and models of aggression and conflict in language.
Typology of verbal aggression and related phenomenon.
Discursive studies of verbal aggression, impoliteness and related phenomena
in language.
Trolling, hate speech, cyberbullying and aggression on the web.
Abusive language and aggression on the web.
Multilingualism and aggression.
Resource Development - Speech and Text Corpora, Annotation Guidelines and
Best Practices for aggression detection
Computational Models and Methods for aggression detection in text and
speech.
Automatic detection of aggression on the web (both text and speech).
Automatic detection of trolling and cyberbullying on the web (both text and
speech).
Automatic detection of physical threat on the web (both text and speech).
Automatic detection of hate speech on the web (both text and speech).
Automatic censorship and moderation: ethical, legal and technological
issues and challenges (both text and speech).

*Submission*
The papers might be submitted for one of the following categories -
Long Paper (completed work - 9 pages)
Short Paper (work in progress - 5 pages)
Demo of a working system/library / API (described in maximum 2 pages, with
a link to the actual system, if available) - we strongly prefer open-source
and free systems for demo at the workshop
Both long and short papers may be presented using PowerPoint or Poster,
depending on the medium that is considered most appropriate for the paper
by the Program Committee. Please note the workshop does not make any
hierarchical distinction between papers and posters and the decision does
NOT reflect the quality of the paper - the choice between the two mediums
of presentation will only be made based on its suitability and
appropriateness for presenting the content of the paper.

Submissions should be formatted according to the COLING 2018 template (
<A HREF="http://coling2018.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/coling2018.zip">http://coling2018.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/coling2018.zip</A>) - these
are provided in LaTeX and also Microsoft Word format on the COLING Website.
As with the main conference, submissions will only be accepted in PDF
format and deviations from the provided templates will result in rejections
without review. Papers are to be submitted by the end of the deadline day
