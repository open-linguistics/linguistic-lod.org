<PRE>Call for Workshop Papers

Fourth International Workshop on 'Applied Intelligent Information 
Systems' (AIIS 2018)
In Conjunction with the Thirteenth International Conference on Digital 
Information Management (ICDIM 2018)
<A HREF="http://www.icdim.org/workshop.php">http://www.icdim.org/workshop.php</A>
Berlin, Germany
September 24-26, 2018
Technically co-sponsored by the IEEE Technology Management Council
Accepted workshop papers will be published in the proceedings indexed by 
IEEE Xplore

About the Workshop

Our society needs and expects more high-value services. Such 
&#8221;knowledge-intensive&#8221; services can only be delivered if the necessary 
organizational and technical requirements are fulfilled. In addition, 
the cost-benefit analysis from the service provider point of view needs 
to be positive. There is a large and rapidly increasing literature on 
how artificial intelligence might be used to develop more &#8220;intelligent&#8221; 
information systems. The proposed workshop will address all possible 
research in the Intelligent Information Systems. The workshop will 
primarily address the following themes

Information Storage and Retrieval
Data Structures, Cryptology and Information Theory
Artificial Intelligence (incl. Robotics)
IT in Business
Document Preparation and Text Processing
Industry Sectors
Electronics
IT &amp; Software
Telecommunications
