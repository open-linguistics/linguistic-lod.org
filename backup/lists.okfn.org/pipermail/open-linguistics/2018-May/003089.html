3rd and last&#160; Call for Papers for
*SemDeep-3 *
***<A HREF="http://www.dfki.de/semdeep-3/callforpapers.html*">http://www.dfki.de/semdeep-3/callforpapers.html*</A>
*Workshop on Semantic Deep Learning *collocated with COLING 2018.
*===========================================================*
IMPORTANT DATES
-----------------------
STRICT Paper Submission Deadline: May&#160;25, 2018 (11:50 pm CET)
Notification of Acceptance: June&#160;20, 2018
Camera-Ready Papers Due: June 30, 2018
Workshop Dates: August&#160;20, 2018
Conference Dates: August 20-25, 2018
CALL FOR PAPERS
-----------------------
With the experiences gained from two previous workshops on Semantic Deep 
Learning,
we would like to take this endeavor one step further by providing a 
platform at COLING 2018
where researchers and professionals in computational linguistics are 
invited to report results and
systems on the possible contributions of Deep Learning to classic 
problems in semantic applications,
such as meaning representation, dependency parsing, semantic role 
labelling, word sense
disambiguation, semantic relation extraction, statistical relational 
learning, knowledge base
completion, or semantically grounded inference.
There are notable examples of contributions leveraging either deep 
neural architectures or distributed
representations learned via deep neural networks in the broad area of 
Semantic Web technologies.
These include, among others: (lightweight) ontology learning, ontology 
alignment , ontology annotation,
and ontology prediction. Ontologies, on the other hand, have been 
repeatedly utilized as background
knowledge for machine learning tasks. As an example, there is a myriad 
of hybrid approaches for
learning embeddings by jointly incorporating corpus-based evidence and 
semantic resources.
This interplay between structured knowledge and corpus-based approaches 
has given way to
knowledge-rich embeddings, which in turn have proven useful for tasks 
such as hypernym discovery ,
collocation discovery and classification, word sense disambiguation, and 
many others.
We thus invite submissions that illustrate how NLP can benefit from the 
interaction between deep learning
and Semantic Web resources and technologies. At the same time, we are 
interested in submissions that
show how knowledge representation can assist in deep learning tasks 
deployed in the field of NLP
and how knowledge representation systems can build on top of deep 
learning results, for example
in the field of Neural Machine Translation (NMT).
TOPICS OF INTEREST
-----------------------
Structured knowledge in deep learning:
- neural networks and logic rules for semantic compositionality
- learning and applying knowledge graph embeddings to NLP tasks
- learning semantic similarity and encoding distances as knowledge graph
- ontology-based text classification
- multilingual resources for neural representations of linguistics
- semantic role labeling
Deep reasoning and inferences:
- commonsense reasoning and vector space models
- reasoning with deep learning methods
Learning knowledge representations with deep learning
-&#160; deep learning methods for knowledge-base completion
- deep learning models for learning knowledge representations from text
- deep learning ontological annotations
Joint tasks:
-&#160; information retrieval and extraction with knowledge graphs and deep 
learning models
- knowledge-based deep word sense disambiguation and entity linking
- investigation of compatibilities and incompatibilities between deep 
learning and Semantic Web approaches
SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS
-----------------------
Authors are invited to submit papers describing original, unpublished
work, completed or in progress. The papers should be maximally 9
pages with maximally 2 additional pages for references.
The COLING 2018 templates must be used. Paper submission will be
electronic in PDF format through the SoftConf conference management system.
Workshop Proceedings will be published by COLING 2018.
REVIEWING POLICY
----------------
Reviewing will be double-blind, so authors need to conceal their
identity. The paper should not include the authors' names and 
affiliations, nor any acknowledgements. Limit anonymized
self-references only to articles that are relevant for reviewers.
