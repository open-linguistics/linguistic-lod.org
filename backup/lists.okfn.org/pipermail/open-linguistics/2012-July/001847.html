Detection, Representation, and Exploitation of Events
in the Semantic Web (DeRiVE 2012)
<A HREF="http://semanticweb.cs.vu.nl/derive2012">http://semanticweb.cs.vu.nl/derive2012</A>

Workshop in conjunction with ISWC 2012, the
10th International Semantic Web Conference
11/12 November 2012, Boston, USA 

*Submission deadline*: Tuesday, 31 July 2012, 23:59 (Hawaii Time)

ABSTRACT

The goal of DeRiVE 2012 is to strengthen the participation of the semantic web community in the recent surge of research on the use of events as a key concept for representing knowledge and organising and structuring media on the web. The workshop invites contributions to three central questions, and its goal is to formulate answers to these questions that advance and reflect the current state of understanding. Each submission will be expected to address at least two questions explicitly, if possible including a system demonstration. This year, we specifically invite contributions that address both event and conversation semantics in multimedia and social media. The most substantial contributions to the workshop will be presented orally (and if possible with a demo) in sessions organised according to the questions addressed, with time allocated for deep discussion. The workshop will also include a lightning talk session for late-breaking work.

WHY IS THIS TOPIC IMPORTANT?

In recent years, researchers in several communities involved in aspects of the web have begun to realise the potential benefits of assigning an important role to events in the representation and organisation of knowledge and media&#8212;benefits which can be compared to those of representing entities such as persons or locations instead of just dealing with more superficial objects such as proper names and geographical coordinates. While a good deal of relevant research&#8212;for example, on the modelling of events&#8212;has been done in the semantic web community, much complementary research has been done in other, partially overlapping communities, such as those involved in multimedia processing and information retrieval. However, there is a shift in semantics in multimedia research, one that moves away from content semantics towards conversation semantics that is contained in social media.  With respect to events and information, what happens in an event becomes secondary to how people react and/or what they talk about.  The attendance of DeRiVE 2011 proved that there is a great interest from many different communities in the role of events. The goal of DeRiVE 2012 is to further strengthen and expand on the results from DeRiVE 2011 and  to advance research on the role of events within the semantic web community, both building on existing work and integrating results and methods from other areas, while focusing on issues of special importance for the semantic web.

INTENDED AUDIENCE

Participants will come from various areas of research that are represented in the semantic web community such as: artificial intelligence, information, multimedia, and communication technologies, data mining, data science, human-computer interaction, humanities, and web information systems. Some participants will probably be especially interested in particular application areas, such as tourism, entertainment, cultural heritage, or government. 

GOALS AND STRUCTURE

Each submission should explicitly address at least two of the three questions. In addition to presenting specific results, the paper should discuss the more general implications for the questions that it addresses.
			
Where feasible, a workshop presentation should include a system demonstration that illustrates the key ideas of the work and encourages interactive discussion at the workshop. In such cases, the submission should include some text describing the demonstration. Papers that present tangible contributions independently of a demonstration will also be accepted.

Question 1: How can events be detected and extracted for the semantic web?

How can events be recognised in particular types of material on the web, such as calendars of public events, social networks, microblogging sites, semantic wikis, and regular web pages?
How can events be summarised, segmented and described using social media?
How can the quality and veracity of the events mentioned in noisy microblogging sites such as Twitter be verified?
How can a system recognise a complex event that comprises separately recognisable subevents?
How can a system recognise when a newly detected event is the same as a previously detected and represented event?
			
Question 2: How can events be modelled and represented in the semantic web?

How can we improve the interoperability of the various event vocabularies such as EVENT, LODE, SEM, or F to name a few?
How deployed is the schema.org Event class on the web?
To what extent can the many different event infoboxes of Wikipedia be reconciled for Wikidata?
What are the requirements for event representations for qualitatively different types of events (e.g., historical events such as wars; cultural events such as upcoming concerts; personal events such as family vacations)? How can aspects of existing event representations developed in other communities be adapted to the needs of the semantic web?

To what extent can/should a unified event model be employed for such different types of events?
How do social contexts (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) change the implicit content semantics?
		
Question 3: What is the relationship between events, data, and applications?

How can events be represented in a way to support conversation semantics, search, or enhanced browsing?
How do tools for event annotation and consumption alter or change the content semantics of the event itself?

How can we improve existing methods for visualising event representations and enabling users to interact with them in semantic web user interfaces?

What are the requirements for event detection, representation, and systems creation implicitly or explicitly defined by these three questions?	

IMPORTANT DATES

Deadline for paper submission: Tuesday, 31 July 2012, 23:59 (Hawaiian time)
Notification of acceptance/rejection: Tuesday, 21 August 2012
Deadline for camera-ready version: Tuesday, 4 September 2012

Deadline for lightning talk abstract submission: Sunday 4 November 2012, 23:59 (Hawaiian time)

Workshop: Sunday or Monday, 11 or 12 November 2012

SUBMISSIONS

Submissions should explicitly address two or more of the three main workshop questions and not exceed 10 pages. In addition to presenting specific results, the paper should discuss the more general implications for the questions that it addresses. Abstracts for lightning talks should describe ongoing work concerning one or more of the three main workshop questions and not exceed 2 pages. The abstracts will be reviewed lightly by the organising committee for appropriateness to the workshop. 

All submissions must be in PDF format and must follow the LNCS
