<PRE>==== Call for Papers (WHiSe III) ====
3rd Workshop on Humanities in the Semantic Web - WHiSe III

Date: May 20, 21, or 22, 2019 (to be confirmed)
Venue: Leipzig, Germany (co-located with LDK 2019)
Hashtag: #whise2019
Twitter: @whiseworkshop
Site: <A HREF="http://whise.kmi.open.ac.uk/">http://whise.kmi.open.ac.uk/</A>

Workshop chairs:
- Alessandro Adamou - Data Science Institute, NUI Galway, Ireland
- Marieke van Erp - KNAW Humanities Cluster, The Netherlands
- Albert Mero&#195;&#177;o-Pe&#195;&#177;uela - Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, The Netherlands


# DESCRIPTION

The emergence of tractable and affordable methods for the collection, enhancement and
analysis of data generated en masse has helped shape several research fields, such as
social sciences, into structured research fields. Digital Humanities are enjoying such a
transformation to the point that their very boundaries and methodological foundations are
being called into question. The quality and relevance of findings obtained from the
thorough, human-driven analysis of a few sources, compared to unsupervised large-scale
analytics on masses of data, is a fervent ongoing debate; and yet, the latter cannot
prescind from a conscious effort in shaping the world to which the analyses need to
relate. This has largely taken the form of knowledge modelling efforts, from which many
ontologies, controlled vocabularies and conceptual models like CIDOC-CRM, the Europeana
Data Model and FRBRoo have arisen. However, other fields traditionally less reliant on
machine-readable data have seen the emergence of &#226;&#8364;&#732;ecological&#226;&#8364;&#8482; communities with an approach
to the Web of Data. Recent examples include the 2014 ISAW papers for the ancient world,
Transforming Musicology for music and musicology (<A HREF="http://www.transforming-musicology.org/">http://www.transforming-musicology.org/</A>)
and Linked Pasts for history and archaeology (<A HREF="http://commons.pelagios.org/groups/linked-pasts/">http://commons.pelagios.org/groups/linked-pasts/</A>).

As these emerging research networks deal with the reality of the Semantic Web and the
ever-growing Linked Data Cloud, the WHiSe workshop series was conceived from a reflection
on the extent to which the Semantic Web community is serving the needs of historians,
philologists, cultural critics, musicologists and other humanists that generally: (1)
cannot rely on structured data generated en masse through social networks or online media
platforms; (2) deal with vague, fragmentary, uncertain, contradictory and yet still
valuable evidence that poses a challenge even to Artificial Intelligence research per se;
(3) have good reason to value the systematic investigation of a few sources over the
(semi-)automated analytical findings on masses of content. WHiSe addresses this need by
promoting dialogue between humanists who employ or are contemplating Semantic Web
technologies, and Semantic Web scholars providing accounts of applied research in the
Humanities. It will also be a forum for raising opportunities to explore novel research
problems that can be relevant to both communities.

WHiSe III welcomes original research contributions crossing Humanities and the Semantic
Web. Scholars who have conducted research or developed impactful applications are invited
to submit full papers (12 pages, Springer LNCS typeset) with appropriately evaluated
contributions. WHiSe III also welcomes short vision or position papers (6 pages, Springer
LNCS typeset) on novel challenges or approaches to existing problems.

Topics include, but are not limited to:

- Knowledge base generation from classical texts
- Linking data within and across gazetteers
- Semantic enrichment of data from historical records and biographies
- Ecosystems and process descriptions for linking data in the humanities
- Linked Digital Libraries and semantic archives
- Ontology adoption in specific domains in the humanities
- Knowledge graph construction and exploitation within and across domains
- Computational methods for the prosopography of historical figures
- Capturing, modelling and reasoning on musical data
- The role of ontologies and controlled vocabularies in data preservation
- Criticism of Semantic Web standards from the point of view of humanities scholarship
- Ethical issues in using Semantic Web and Linked Data and their impact on the openness of
traditional research data
- Notions on integrating digital humanities and data science
- Knowledge bottlenecks and practical difficulties in using Semantic Web technologies by
humanities scholars
- Utopian / dystopian visions of the Semantic Web of the future

Submissions in all the categories mentioned above (both full and short papers) will be
peer-reviewed by acknowledged researchers familiar with both scientific communities.
Accepted papers will be published as online proceedings courtesy of CEUR-WS.org&lt;<A HREF="http://CEUR-WS.org">http://CEUR-WS.org</A>&gt;.


# IMPORTANT DATES

Submission deadline: Tuesday, March 5, 2019
Notification to authors: Tuesday, April 2, 2019
Camera-ready due on: Wednesday, April 17, 2019
Workshop day: May 20, 2019


# SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

Papers will be evaluated according to their significance, originality, technical content,
style, clarity, and relevance to the workshop. We welcome the following types of
contributions:

- Full papers (up to 12 pages)
- Short papers (up to 6 pages)

All submissions must be PDF documents written in English and formatted according to LNCS
instructions for authors <A HREF="http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0">http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0</A>).
Page limits are inclusive of references and appendices, if any. Papers are to be submitted
through the Easychair Conference Management System (<A HREF="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=whise3">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=whise3</A>).
Please note that paper submissions to WHiSe III are not anonymous.

At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the workshop, in order to
present the paper there, and to the conference. For further instructions please refer to
the LDK 2019 page (<A HREF="http://2019.ldk-conf.org/">http://2019.ldk-conf.org/</A>).

## PRIOR PUBLICATION AND MULTIPLE SUBMISSIONS

Every submitted paper must represent original and unpublished work: it must not be under
review or accepted elsewhere and there must be a significantly clear element of novelty
distinguishing a submitted paper from any other prior publication or current submission.
