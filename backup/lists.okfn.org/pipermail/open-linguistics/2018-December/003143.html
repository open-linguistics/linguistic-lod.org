&#160;
INTERNATIONAL SPRING SCHOOL ON ROBOTICS

&#160;
Robotic 2019

&#160;
Bucharest, Romania

&#160;
April 8-12, 2019

&#160;

Co-organized by:

&#160;

University Politehnica of Bucharest

&#160;

Institute for Research Development, Training and Advice (IRDTA)

Brussels / London

********************************************************

&#160;

--- Early registration deadline: December 31st, 2018 ---

&#160;

********************************************************

&#160;
SCOPE:

&#160;

Robotic 2019 will be a research training event with a global scope aiming at updating participants on the most recent advances in the critical and fast developing area of robotics, which covers a large spectrum of current exciting research and industrial innovation with an extraordinary potential for a huge impact on engineering, medicine, science, business models, and daily life. Renowned academics and industry pioneers will lecture and share their views with the audience.

&#160;

Most robotics subareas will be displayed, namely the conception, design, manufacturing and operation of robots. This involves addressing their sensing capabilities, manipulation, locomotion, interaction with the environment, interaction with humans, control, etc. The field is multidisciplinary at the crossroads of artificial intelligence, engineering, electronics, mechatronics, bioengineering and nanotechnology. Major challenges of robotics will be identified through 2 keynote lectures, 20 five-hour courses, and 1 round table, which will tackle the most active and promising topics. The organizers are convinced that outstanding speakers will attract the brightest and most motivated students. Interaction will be a main component of the event.

&#160;

An open session will give participants the opportunity to present their own work in progress in 5 minutes. Moreover, there will be two special sessions with industrial and recruitment profiles.

&#160;
ADDRESSED TO:

&#160;

Graduate students, PhD students, postdocs, and industry practitioners will be typical profiles of participants. However, there are no formal pre-requisites for attendance in terms of academic degrees. Since there will be a variety of levels, specific knowledge background may be assumed for some of the courses. Overall, Robotic 2019 is addressed to students, researchers and practitioners who want to keep themselves updated about recent developments and future trends. All will surely find it fruitful to listen and discuss with major researchers, industry leaders and innovators.

&#160;
STRUCTURE:

&#160;

3 courses will run in parallel during the whole event. Participants will be able to freely choose the courses they wish to attend as well as to move from one to another.

&#160;
