===============================================
Doing Good by Linking Entities, Developer's Challenge
<A HREF="http://wole2013.eurecom.fr/challenge">http://wole2013.eurecom.fr/challenge</A>

2nd International Workshop on Web of Linked Entities (WoLE2013)
In conjunction with the 22nd International World Wide Web Conference
(WWW2013), Rio de Janeiro, 13 May 20132
===============================================

The WoLE2013 Challenge is offering prizes for the best applications that
show the impact of the Web of Linked Entities on problems/solutions
affecting the local community, e.g. detecting corruption, tracking
criminality, facilitating access to education or health services, helping
to search for the cure for neglected diseases, promoting citizen
participation on the government, improving tourism-related services, etc.

Although we have observed an explosion of the number of structured data
sources shared on the &#8220;Web of Data&#8221;, the majority of the available Web
content is still unstructured or semi-structured -- e.g. encoded in
(hyper-) textual documents. Web content (structured, unstructured and
semi-structured) often makes references to other documents or to entities
described in structured data sources (e.g. Linked Data). Moreover,
structured data sources provide entity to entity interconnections,
resulting in a Web of Linked Entities spanning structured and unstructured
data.

We believe that interconnecting and sharing explicit interconnections
between documents and open data sources on the Web will increase the value
of each data source and enable a number of innovative applications that
leverage both the individual data sources and their interconnections.

Submissions will be judged based on originality, potential impact and
pertinence to the subject of the workshop. Note to prospective
participants: if you run a website that has (potential) social impact, but
you are not an expert on WoLE research/technologies, or if you are a
technical person that needs ideas for applications with high potential for
the region, we have prepared a team for assisting you with
questions/answers. Please e-mail <A HREF="https://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-linguistics">wole2013 at easychair.org.</A>

PRIZES
-----------
We will award up to 2 iPad2 32GB to the best application(s).

HOW TO PARTICIPATE
--------------------------------
Submit your application to the challenge at:
<A HREF="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wole2013">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wole2013</A>

RULES
-----------
Applications must use as an important component of the application, one or
more of the following:
- URIs as identifiers for entities: suppose your application talks about
Pel&#233;, the Brazilian football legend. When outputting content for third
parties to use, instead of (or in addition to) using plain old strings such
as &#8220;Pel&#233;&#8221; or &#8220;Edson Arantes do Nascimento&#8221;, or even internal database
identifiers such as &#8220;123&#8221;, your application should point to globally unique
identifiers on the Web. You may use identifiers for that entity (e.g.
<A HREF="http://dbpedia.org/page/Pel%C3%A9">http://dbpedia.org/page/Pel%C3%A9</A>), or identifiers for documents that talk
about that entity (e.g. <A HREF="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pel&#233;">http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pel&#233;</A>)
- Markup languages (such as Microdata or RDFa) for semantic typing of
content according to a domain of knowledge, rather than describing the
structure or presentation of a Web page, preferably in combination with
Schema.org or other schemata that provide URIs for their types.
- Information Extraction (IE) techniques that allow one to automatically
recognize names of entities (e.g. Named Entity Recognition), guess a unique
identifier for a name given the context (e.g. disambiguation, entity
linking) or guess relationships involving entities (e.g. relationship
extraction).
- Reuse available Open Data or produce data that qualifies as 4 or 5-star
Open Data (<A HREF="http://5stardata.info/">http://5stardata.info/</A>).

Submissions must include a link to a functional application available on
the Web, are encouraged to include a short paper (PDF document) with the
description of the application of 2-4 pages in English language, and can
optionally provide a screencast or other video. Make sure that your short
paper contains all the information that a README file would contain, in
order to make your application usable and/or your experiment reproducible:
i.e. which datasets are used, how entities are collected, which information
extraction system was used, with which settings, etc.
The papers, video and link to the application will be available from the
workshop website.

For winning entries:
- must provide a video presentation of their application to be shown during
the workshop.
