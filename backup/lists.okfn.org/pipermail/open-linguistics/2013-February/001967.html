===============================================
2nd International Workshop on Web of Linked Entities (WoLE2013)
<A HREF="http://wole2013.eurecom.fr">http://wole2013.eurecom.fr</A>

In conjunction with the 22nd International World Wide Web Conference
(WWW2013), Rio de Janeiro, 13 May 2013
===============================================

The explosive growth in the amount of data created and shared on the &#8220;Web
of Data&#8221; is now firmly established. However, the majority of the available
Web content is still unstructured or semi-structured. As a general trend,
unstructured data seems to be growing faster than structured data.
According to a 2011 IDC study, unstructured data will account for 90
percent of all data created in the next decade. As the main goal of the Web
of Data is to stimulate the emergence of new dedicated applications giving
the machines ability to process information, there is a strong need to
extract as far as possible structured data from unstructured content
available on the web. Furthermore, structured data sources provide entity
to entity interconnections, resulting in a Web of Linked Entities spanning
structured and unstructured data. According to this, there is also a strong
emergent need to study how to associate non structured content (like
textual documents) and structured content (like RDF triples) with
information retrieval, extraction, integration and exploration existing
techniques. The WoLE workshop series envisions a Web of Linked Entities
(WoLE), which transparently connects the World Wide Web (WWW) and the Giant
Global Graph (GGG) using methods from Information Retrieval (IR), Natural
Language Processing (NLP) and Database Systems (DB) research communities.
The previous edition of WoLE workshop have shown that different methods
involved in specific research tasks of those communities (like co-reference
detection in NLP or information extraction in IR) can provide different
ways to improve the web of Linked Entities content and its relation with
unstructured documents. According to this, the primary goal of WoLE is to
confront propositions from IR, NLP and DB research communities describing
how their specific methods can improve quality of the Web data, structure
its documents and help to explore its content.

OBJECTIVES AND TOPICS  (but are not limited to):
* Text and web mining
* Pattern and semantic analysis of natural language, reading the web,
learning by reading
* Large-scale information extraction
* Usage mining
* Entity resolution and automatic discovery of entities
* Frequent pattern analysis of entities and/or relationships
* Entity linking, named entity disambiguation, cross-document co-reference
resolution
* Ontology representation of natural language text
* Analysis of ontology models for natural language text
* Learning and refinement of ontologies
* Natural language taxonomies modeled to Semantic Web ontologies
* Disambiguation with the support of knowledge bases
* Multilingual information extraction
* Use cases of entity recognition for Linked Data applications
* Relationship extraction, slot filling
* Impact of entity linking on information retrieval, semantic search,
entity oriented search
* Semantic relatedness and similarity using entities and relations

SUBMISSION AND PUBLICATION:
We invite submissions of full papers (max. 8 pages) and short papers (max.
4 pages). All submissions will be reviewed by at least three program
committee members, and will be assessed based on their novelty, technical
quality, potential impact, and clarity of writing.
The workshop proceedings will be published through the ACM Digital Library.
Please, submit in PDF format to:
<A HREF="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wole2013.">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wole2013.</A> Submissions must:

- be in PDF (make sure that the PDF can be viewed on any platform);
- be formatted for the US Letter size;
It is authors&#8217; responsibility to ensure that their submission adhere
strictly to the required format. Submissions that do not comply with the
above guidelines will be rejected without review.
