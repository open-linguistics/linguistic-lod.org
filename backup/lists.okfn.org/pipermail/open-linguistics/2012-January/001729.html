2ND CALL FOR PAPERS

3rd Workshop of the People's Web meets NLP:
Collaboratively Constructed Semantic Resources and their Applications to NLP

Jeju, Republic of Korea
July 12-13, 2012
<A HREF="http://www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/scientific-community/acl-2012-workshop">http://www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/scientific-community/acl-2012-workshop</A>


===Schedule===

March 18, 2012          Paper submission deadline (full and short)
April 16, 2012          Notification of acceptance
April 30, 2012          Camera-ready version due
July 12-13, 2012        ACL 2012 Workshops


===Introduction===

Recent recognition of Collaboratively Constructed Semantic Resources (CSRs) has
substantially contributed to the research in natural language processing (NLP).
The 3rd workshop &quot;The People's Web meets NLP&quot; invites both long and short papers
on various CSRs-related topics. Preference will be given to submissions on CSRs'
application to NLP tasks, which is the special interest of this workshop
edition. We also welcome tutorial-like submissions on using the software for
CSRs to facilitate their wide adoption by the NLP community.

Specific topics include but are not limited to:
* Using collaboratively constructed resources and the information mined from 
  them for NLP tasks (cf. Section &quot;References&quot;), such as word sense 
  disambiguation, semantic role labeling, information retrieval, text 
  categorization, information extraction, question answering, etc.; 
* Mining social and collaborative content for constructing structured lexical 
  semantic resources, annotated corpora and the corresponding tools; 
* Analyzing the structure of collaboratively constructed resources related to 
  their use in NLP; 
* Computational linguistics studies of collaboratively constructed resources, 
  such as wiki-based platforms or folksonomies; 
* Structural and semantic interoperability of collaboratively constructed 
  resources with conventional semantic resources and between themselves; 
* Mining multilingual information from collaboratively constructed resources;
* Using special features of collaboratively constructed resources to create 
  novel resource types, for example revision-based corpora, simplified versions
  of resources, etc.; 
* Quality and reliability of collaboratively constructed lexical semantic 
  resources and annotated corpora; 
* Hands-on practical knowledge on utilization of CSR APIs and tools or designing 
  crowdsourcing procedures for high quality outcomes. 

Though the workshop welcomes any CSRs-related topics, preference will be given 
to submissions on CSRs' application to NLP tasks, which is the special interest 
of this workshop edition. Thereby, we encourage the participation of researchers 
with various backgrounds: from computational linguistics (e.g. parsing and 
discourse analysis) to NLP applications and other areas that might benefit from 
collaboratively constructed semantic resources. Given that we receive a 
sufficient number of tutorial-like submissions, a dedicated presentation session 
for those will be scheduled.
