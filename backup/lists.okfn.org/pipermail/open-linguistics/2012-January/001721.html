                               Istanbul, Turkey

To answer the growing need and lower the costs of resource creation and enhancement, 
there is a movement within the community toward collaborative resource development, 
including collaborative corpus annotation and collective creation/enhancement of 
lexical resources and knowledge bases. Collaborative development encompasses both
engaging the community in annotation and development of common resources, as
well as crowd-sourcing and similar solutions.

This workshop seeks contributions in all dimensions of collaborative resource
development and delivery, with a specific focus on case studies and lessons
learned. We invite submissions that address but are not limited to the following
topics: 
  - Web services and platforms for collaborative resource development and
    distribution; 
  - Crowd sourcing for resource development, including studies of efficacy; 
  - Strategies and issues for open resource distribution; 
  - Evaluation of collaboratively developed resources; 
  - Position papers outlining issues and proposing solutions for community-based 
    collaborative resource development and/or delivery.

---------------
Special Session
---------------

The workshop will include a special session devoted to means and considerations
for community-based linguistic annotation, with a special emphasis on the
Manually Annotated Sub-Corpus (MASC) (<A HREF="http://www.anc.org/MASC">http://www.anc.org/MASC</A>). We invite
submissions to this session on the following topics: 

  - position papers concerning any aspect of collaborative resource development, 
    including means to get the community fully invested in such efforts; 
  - case studies describing collaborative development efforts, including assessment 
    of what works and what doesn't; 
  - results obtained using collaboratively developed resources; 
  - the role of standards and best practices in collaboratively developed resources 
    and contributed annotations.

Special consideration will be given to contributions that have used MASC data in
a way that highlights the benefits of community-based annotation.
