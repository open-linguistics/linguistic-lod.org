Conference on Language, Data and Knowledge (LDK 2019)
<A HREF="http://2019.ldk-conf.org">http://2019.ldk-conf.org</A>

We invite submissions to the second biennial conference on Language,
Data and Knowledge (LDK 2019), which will be held in Leipzig, Germany in
May 2019. This conference aims at bringing together researchers from
across disciplines concerned with the acquisition, curation and use of
language data in the context of data science and knowledge-based
applications. This builds upon the success of the inaugural event held
in Galway, Ireland in 2017.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Paper submission
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Submissions can be in the form of:

- Long research papers: 10-15 pages;
- Short research or position papers: 6-8 pages;
- Short scientific abstract submissions: be 4-6 pages.

All submissions lengths are given including references and optional
appendices.

Accepted submissions will be published by OASIcs in an open-access
conference proceedings volume. The layout templates are available for
download from the OASIcs website at:
<A HREF="https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/oasics/instructions-for-authors/">https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/oasics/instructions-for-authors/</A>

Submission is double-blind and hence all submissions should be suitably
anonymized by omitting author names in the header and citing previous
own work in the third person (not &quot;as we showed in ...&quot;&quot; but &quot;as Smith
(2017) showed ...&quot;&quot;).

Papers should be submitted via EasyChair at the following address:
<A HREF="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ldk2019">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ldk2019</A>


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Presentation format
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Accepted submissions will be selected for oral or poster presentation
based on recommendations from the reviewers (with no difference in
quality between types of presentation).

Authors of accepted short papers and scientific abstract are welcome to
present their work as a demo in addition to the regular presentation.
At least one author of each accepted paper must register to present the
paper at the conference.
