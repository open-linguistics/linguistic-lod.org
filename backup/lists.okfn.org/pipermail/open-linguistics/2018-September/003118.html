The posters and demos track of ESWC provides a forum for late-breaking results, on-going research projects, and innovative ideas, as well as prototypes of semantic technologies and their applications in various domains. Submissions to the posters and demos track may cover all areas of Semantic Web research and applications, such as Linked Data and Knowledge Graphs, Ontologies, Reasoning, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Information Retrieval, Data Quality and Data Integration, and Semantic Data Management, as well as applications from Life Sciences, eGovernment, Business, Manufacturing, eScience, Emergency and Crisis Management, etc. Posters and demos will be presented in a separate, interactive session, providing the opportunity for engaging in discussions and direct exchange.

Submission Guidelines
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ** * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 
Authors must submit a short paper (Springer LNCS style, <A HREF="https://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0">https://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0</A> &lt;<A HREF="https://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0">https://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0</A>&gt;). Poster submissions are at most four pages long, demo submissions are at most five pages long.
Poster submissions are expected to contain a short abstract for evaluation, while demonstration track submissions must additionally provide a textual description of the demonstration to be given at the conference (which may include screenshots and must include either a link to the online demo or a video presenting it). The submissions must clearly demonstrate relevance to the Semantic Web and the topics of interest of ESWC 2019. Decisions about acceptance will be based on relevance to the Semantic Web, originality, potential significance, topicality, and clarity. Papers that exceed the given page length or do not follow the LNCS guidelines will be rejected without review. Furthermore, double submissions to other any conferences, workshops, or tracks of ESWC will be rejected. Posters and demonstrations accompanying an accepted research or in-use/industrial track paper must be marked as such and provide an explanation of the additional value of the P&amp;D submission. Submissions must be uploaded on Easychair at <A HREF="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eswc2019posterdemo">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eswc2019posterdemo</A> &lt;<A HREF="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eswc2019posterdemo">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eswc2019posterdemo</A>&gt;
