==== Call for Extended Abstracts ====
1st Workshop on Reframing Research (RefResh 2018) at the European Computational Social Science symposium (EuroCSS)

Date: 5th December 2018
Venue: Cologne, Germany
Twitter: @refreshworkshop
Twitter Hashtag: #RefResh2018
Website: <A HREF="http://refresh.kmi.open.ac.uk">http://refresh.kmi.open.ac.uk</A>


# IMPORTANT DATES

- Submission deadline: 7th October 2018, 23:59 Hawaii Time (sharp)
- Notification to authors: 21st October 2018, 23:59 Hawaii Time


# DESCRIPTION

The main objective of RefResh 2018 is to bring together researchers from both quantitative and qualitative studies, practitioners and policymakers working in the field of academic research, scholarly communication, and knowledge production in order to reframe research in relation to the underlying socioeconomic and geopolitical canvas.
In particular, we intend to encourage interdisciplinary analysis that considers research as a complex system that influences and is influenced by society, economics, culture, and politics. This would include analysis of academic social networks and interactions among different communities, exploration of factors influencing or preventing scientific collaboration and knowledge dissemination, exploration of trends, polarisations and biases in research, methodologies, indicators and measures for assessing research impact on society and industry, policies and practices fostering a better scientific progress, and so on.


# TOPICS OF INTEREST

We encourage submission of papers covering, but not limited to, one or more of the following topics:
- Analysis of patterns and trends in academia
- Research equality, fair opportunities and access to funding streams
- Gender, racial and geographic trends and biases
- Mutual influence of research and politics
- Societal impact of research
- Analysis of researchers mobility and careers
- Predatory publishing and bogus conferences
- Misrepresentation of science and public opinion mining
- Acceleration of scientific progress
- Structure and evolution of science
- Evolution and diffusion of research concepts across research areas
- x.metrics (scientometrics, informetrics and altmetrics)
- Assessment of interdisciplinarity
- Impact of Open Access and Open Science
- Policy-making and strategic decision for research
- Traditional publishing caveat, critiques and alternative models
- Novel peer review practices


# SUBMISSIONS

RefResh 2018 looks for extended abstracts around the listed topics summarising the work to be presented.
We encourage researchers to also submit extended abstracts of work that has already been published and/or submit work in progress. Research, data and position papers are welcome.
Submissions have to be up to 3 pages (in English) excluding references in Springer LNCS format (available at <A HREF="http://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines">http://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines</A>).
Papers have to be submitted as PDF files through EasyChair conference management system at <A HREF="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=refresh20180">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=refresh20180</A>
Papers will be evaluated according to their significance, originality, technical content, style, clarity, and relevance to the workshop. RefResh also supports the Linked Research principles; we applaud authors having the care to consider them when preparing their papers.
It is our intention to publish the workshop proceedings in CEUR workshop series (<A HREF="http://ceur-ws.org">http://ceur-ws.org</A>) or, in alternative, as Open Access post-print on Zenodo (<A HREF="https://zenodo.org">https://zenodo.org</A>).
