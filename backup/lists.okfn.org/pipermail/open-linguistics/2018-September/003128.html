<PRE>Hi Christian,

I think CEUR-WS sent a mail around asking about the future licensing method
of papers published in their volumes.

As many of us have published on CEUR-WS, we should strongly encourage them
to adopt a CC-BY license for publications in line with existing open access
principles, e.g., Budapest Open Access Initiative
&lt;<A HREF="https://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/">https://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/</A>&gt;.

I don't see the point in this group putting together another charter on
open access to publications as there are still many available.

I would recommend all on this mailing list who received this email from
Manfred Jeusfeld to respond and recommend that they adopt CC-BY.

Regards,
John

&gt;<i> Dear Sebastian, dear all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> very nice initiative, and I 'm sympathetic with it, but can you be a
</I>&gt;<i> little bit more specific? Do you suggest to design a letter of support for
</I>&gt;<i> CEUR, or to go beyond that and develop a charta for authors to sign, or
</I>&gt;<i> rules of best practice to be followed by editors and conference organizers.
</I>&gt;<i> The latter two seem similar but in fact they are not:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - A charta to be signed by (potential) authors means that either all rules
</I>&gt;<i> should be set to SHOULD rather than MUST -- because authors have limited
</I>&gt;<i> influence on the publication form chosen by organizers and editors. So, if
</I>&gt;<i> an author doesn't want to be self-contradictive, none of these rules should
</I>&gt;<i> prevent him/her from future publishing at the preferred venues of his/her
</I>&gt;<i> target community. Signing your rule 2 as currently stated means, for
</I>&gt;<i> example, that an author should no longer to publish at LREC (CC-BY-NC) --
</I>&gt;<i> ACL would be ok, though, but it doesn't provide a publication channel for
</I>&gt;<i> language resources.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Rule of best practice for editors and conference organizers can be much
</I>&gt;<i> stricter, and they can work like a Certification Mark (think of Fairtrade),
</I>&gt;<i> with a nice logo as a visual sign of their high standards, but then we need
</I>&gt;<i> some kind of organization to check those conditions. We can indeed act as
</I>&gt;<i> (or form) such an organization -- and automatize these checks --, but we
</I>&gt;<i> need somebody committing him/herself to the task.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think it might work either way. But I also think these rules need a
</I>&gt;<i> deeper discussion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think we need to differentiate between papers and monographs. I don't
</I>&gt;<i> see a good and prominent publication channel for monographs outside the
</I>&gt;<i> publishing industry. Correct my if I'm wrong, but institution-level
</I>&gt;<i> publication (traditionally referred to as &quot;grey literature&quot;) is neither
</I>&gt;<i> equally recognized nor does it help gaining visibility. For example, I
</I>&gt;<i> cannot recall to have seen any book review for such in-house publications
</I>&gt;<i> anywhere, ever.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With respect to CC-BY vs. CC0, the function of CC-BY is not so much to
</I>&gt;<i> make sure people cite you (which they should anyway), but to control how
</I>&gt;<i> they do. It doesn't help your citation score if people point to the URL
</I>&gt;<i> where they got the document from. This is particularly important for
</I>&gt;<i> publishing datasets, because CC-BY 3.0 (or before) allows the author of the
</I>&gt;<i> data set to point to a specific publication to be used (this is the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;title&quot;, dropped in CC-BY 4.0).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With respect to ND, this does not pertain to normal scientific use, e.g.,
</I>&gt;<i> quotes and indirect quotes, because (at least  in German law) that is one
</I>&gt;<i> of the exceptions of copyright (so, this cannot be restricted nor permitted
</I>&gt;<i> by *any* license). However, writing a grammar and then having someone
</I>&gt;<i> (maybe unqualified, in your eyes) to re-write your grammar and publish
</I>&gt;<i> under your both names (perfectly in line with CC-BY) is certainly something
</I>&gt;<i> I can imagine a linguist would like to prevent. So, ND may have a point
</I>&gt;<i> also in our area. It should not be a preferred option, of course.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another area where a charta or rules of best practice would help is to
</I>&gt;<i> bring some structure into the somewhat messy area of green open access,
</I>&gt;<i> i.e., publication via self-archiving or designated websites for draft
</I>&gt;<i> papers (which basically entails NC, cf. <A HREF="https://www.publisso.de/en/adv">https://www.publisso.de/en/adv</A>
</I>&gt;<i> ice/publishing-advice-faqs/difference-between-gold-and-green-open-access/).
</I>&gt;<i> When we did the LDL-2012 book, we published with Springer. At this time,
</I>&gt;<i> this was helpful to establish a reference publication for the area, but
</I>&gt;<i> also, the Springer contract explicitly allowed us/the authors to do
</I>&gt;<i> self-archiving (of drafts, not the finals, of course). So, we used this
</I>&gt;<i> exception to create a website with green OA `shadow proceedings'. It lacked
</I>&gt;<i> a number of chapters which were specifically written for the book by the
</I>&gt;<i> editors, but it contained the drafts of all accepted submissions. I still
</I>&gt;<i> think that this was a good compromise, also between availability and
</I>&gt;<i> sustainability, because the LDL-2012 website hasn't been reactivated after
</I>&gt;<i> a server crash, whereas the book is still available. (And this is one of
</I>&gt;<i> the great risks associated with community-based, free open access
</I>&gt;<i> publishing -- unless it involves a funding model or a long-term commitment
</I>&gt;<i> of some kind of independently funded organization [such as a library], it
</I>&gt;<i> tends to depend on selected individuals and their positions and if this
</I>&gt;<i> position changes or technical difficulties arise, suddenly everything
</I>&gt;<i> disappears. Think of The Language Archive/DoBeS at MPI Nijmegen and its
</I>&gt;<i> transition between its original and any possible future home -- at least it
</I>&gt;<i> used to be for several years. I am wondering about the sustainability of
</I>&gt;<i> CEUR, and maybe, their request comes out of exactly this problem.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But green access is `messy' in the sense that different publishers define
</I>&gt;<i> it differently. Elsevier, for example, puts embargo periods of different
</I>&gt;<i> duration on their green OA papers. In the area of NLP, where pre-prints are
</I>&gt;<i> becoming almost more important than actual publications, this is an
</I>&gt;<i> absolute no-go. On the other hand, in certain areas of linguistics, e.g.,
</I>&gt;<i> when we talk about grammars or dictionaries, waiting for a year or two
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't make much of a difference. Harrassowitz follows this policy, and
</I>&gt;<i> they do a lot of historical and low-resource languages. AFAIK, de Gruyter
</I>&gt;<i> is much more restrictive. For scientific papers, I think it would be nice
</I>&gt;<i> to express a preference of CC-BY over Green OA without embargo period over
</I>&gt;<i> OA with embargo over Gold OA (which tends to be unaffordable) and to
</I>&gt;<i> communicate this to conference organizers and editors of collected volumes.
</I>&gt;<i> Some funding organizations do. The German federal ministry of education and
</I>&gt;<i> science (BMBF) accepts a one-year embargo for Open Access publications.
</I>&gt;<i> However, we might want to formulate our own principles.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just my 2ct. I'm curious what others think.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best,
</I>&gt;<i> Christian

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   Hi all,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   <A HREF="http://ceur-ws.org/">http://ceur-ws.org/</A>     was recently reaching out to strengthen their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> legal position,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      asking for feedback.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   We live in an area of web-publishing. In fact, the role of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      publishers is definitely in question. However. there is no clear
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      idea how to do it.  From my perspective, the publisher function of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      persisting papers can be achieved by libraries/universities. The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      function of distribution and visibility of papers by better and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      free/open metadata.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   If these two functions are substituted - to the best of my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      knowledge -  it seems that a simple codex can be derived with four
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      rules:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   1. papers MUST be published royalty-free without compensation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      (open access for everyone)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   2. Copyright stays with the authors. Authors MAY choose to give
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      up some of their rights and license under CC-BY, as the sole
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      option.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   3. SA, NC, ND are strongly discouraged as they stir false
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      expectations and are conflicting with unwritten academic rules
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   4.  metadata, i.e. bibliographic data like bibtex SHOULD be CC-0
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   Some explanations:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   1. is a no-brainer, papers are published to be read. Payment is a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      serious barrier of knowledge transfer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   2.  this works with transparent web publishing platforms like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://ceur-ws.org/">http://ceur-ws.org/</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      . So it is an idealisation and might not always work *yet*.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   3. in detail:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   - BY, the only viable option matching expectation on reality,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      however an unnecessary one. In science, you are obliged to cite
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      otherwise it is plagiarism, which is serious. So the good
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      scientific practice implies BY without explicit license. On the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      other hand, science is liberal, so you can copy and modify
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      basically anything and use it as long as you cite it. This is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      often anchored in national academic law.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   - ND propagates false expectation, since you can still derive. In
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      fact, science is meant to derive and build upon previous work.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      What good is a license if you can't enforce it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   - NC most of the times the valuable part are the ideas described
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      in the paper. They are described (hopefully ;) in a way so that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      they are reproducible. A license is not a patent, so basically
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      anybody can still exploit your ideas. <A HREF="https://xkcd.com/">https://xkcd.com/</A>     NC
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> makes sense for XKCD, meaning you can't print T-Shirts with it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      and sell it. With papers you can read it and use the information
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      to commercialise, just the exact text is licensed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   - SA In my opinion SA has the purpose that you can track the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      modifcations by others and if something good comes up you can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      reintegrate it as is. I am not sure, if this has a place in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      academic publishing. I can't imagine a scenario, where scientist X
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      publishes under SA and then enforces that scientist Y using and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      citing his work properly is obligated to also publish under SA.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   4. might be changed from SHOULD to MUST clearly we would all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      benefit from this.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    This is the current state in my head as it makes sense to me and I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    see great potential in it. However, we need to discuss, refine and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    consolidate it as a community.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      --
