<PRE>*1st Workshop on eLexicography: Between Digital Humanities and Artificial
Intelligence=======================<A HREF="http://lexdhai.insight-centre.org/">http://lexdhai.insight-centre.org/</A>
&lt;<A HREF="http://lexdhai.insight-centre.org/">http://lexdhai.insight-centre.org/</A>&gt;National University of Ireland, Galway,
Dec 6th.Co-located with EADH 2018.Lexicography is currently embracing rapid
change as the traditional methods of publishing dictionaries are replaced
by the ubiquity of lexical information on the Web. Furthermore, the
application of computational techniques to the process of lexicography are
revolutionizing how dictionaries can be constructed. In this context, the
recently started ELEXIS (<A HREF="http://elex.is">http://elex.is</A> &lt;<A HREF="http://elex.is">http://elex.is</A>&gt;) project aims to
develop a new infrastructure for electronic lexicography across Europe,
that builds a virtuous cycle of lexicography where lexicographic resources
are linked across languages, in order to build improved natural language
processing tools, which can then aid in the construction of novel resources
and retro-digitization of dictionaries, thus driving the cycle. The project
is naturally multilingual covering 15 European countries and has a strong
interest in driving lexicography for under-resourced and minoritized
languages.The workshop has three main aims, firstly we will invite speakers
from existing major lexicographic efforts to provide summaries of the work
at the cutting edge of lexicography. We will invite speakers who are part
of major dictionary efforts and have already approached Oxford English
Dictionaries regarding this. Secondly, we will provide a tutorial and
hands-on with the ELEXIS infrastructure to enable participants to become
familiar with the technologies being developed in the project. Finally, we
will make an open call for posters, which will provide an overview of new
projects in the area of electronic lexicography.Topics of
Interest------------------* Lexicography and Digital Humanities* Access and
usage of dictionaries on the Web* Retro-digitization of lexicographic
resources* Lexicography for language learning* Use and applications of NLP
for lexicography* Lexicography for under-resourced languages* Lexicography
for terminology and translation* Linked Data and AI for lexical
resourcesCall for Papers---------------We welcome submissions of abstracts
of up to 500 words that will be presented as posters at the workshop.
Submissions should present methodologies, experiments, use cases,
descriptions of ongoing or planned research projects and position papers on
topics related to the topics of interest (given above). Furthermore we
especially welcome papers describing interdisciplinary research combining
research in lexicography, linguistics, computer science and digital
humanities approaches.Please submit abstracts by October 19th in English.
Submissions will be reviewed by at least 3 reviewers and will be made
available  online prior to the workshop.Papers should be submitted via
EasyChair at  <A HREF="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lexdhai2018">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lexdhai2018</A>
&lt;<A HREF="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lexdhai2018">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lexdhai2018</A>&gt;Abstracts will be made
available prior to the workshop on the website. Notifications will be sent
by November 2nd and final versions of abstracts will be required by
December 1st.Organizers----------* John P. McCrae, Data Science Institute,
