<PRE>Dear all,


with some faint relation to the recent discussion about publication 
frameworks and licences, I have a question wrt. metadata of 
publications. Is there currently any repository out there with extensive 
covery of our papers on open linguistics / linked data, ideally 
supplying the data in BibTex format? If not, is there any interest in 
creating such a repository? We might be able to host a service in 
Frankfurt providing basic functionality. The idea is that everyone 
submits his locally gathered entries and we merge the files and make 
them publically available. Of course this can only be done if the 
metadata is published under an open licence. Please let me know what you 
think. It might decrease the effort of everyone creating, finding and 
maintaining the metadata on their own.


In addition to that, I wanted to ask about the current status of the 
LLOD cloud. Since the major version update at datahub.io several months 
ago, it is no longer possible to freely upload and maintain datasets 
there. Since a large portion of the LLOD cloud consists of datahub 
entries or datasets referenced through datahub, a decline of cloud size 
might be imminent. I know that John was working on a new web form for 
adding data to the cloud but I am uncertain of the status. Since we are 
on the brink of converting a larger set of XML corpora into CoNLL-RDF it 
would be nice to know about the best practice for adding data to the 
cloud in the future.

Does anyone know if or when old.datahub.io will be closed? Are there any 
plans on how to proceed with affected cloud resources after that? (Esp. 
datasets whose maintainers do not take care of the issue of their own 
accord?)


Best regards and a nice weekend to all of you,

Christian F&#228;th
