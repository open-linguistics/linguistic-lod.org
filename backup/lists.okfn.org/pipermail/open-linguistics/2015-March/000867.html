===============
Important Dates
===============
14 May 2015: Submission deadline for Short and Long Papers
4 June 2015: Notification of Acceptance
21 June 2015: Camera-ready papers due
31 July 2015: Workshop


===============
Scope and Topics
===============
The First Worskop on Computing News Storylines (CNewS 2015) aims at bringing together researchers and scientists working on narrative extraction and representation from news within Computational Linguistics and Artificial Intelligence. Narratives are at the heart of information sharing. Ever since people began to share their experiences, they have connected them to form narratives. Modern day news reports still reflect this narrative structure, but they have proven difficult for automatic tools to summarise, structure, or connect to other reports. Most text processing tools focus on extracting relatively simple structures from the local lexical environment, and concentrate on the document as a unit or on even smaller units such as sentences or phrases, rather than cross-document connections especially published over longer periods of time. However, current information needs demand a move towards multidimensional and distributed representations which take into account the connections between all relevant elements involved in a &#8220;story&#8221;. The workshop aims at assessing the state-of-the-art in event extraction and linking, as well as detecting and ranking narratives according to salience. The workshop invites work on all aspects of generating narrative structures or components thereof from news. This includes topics such as (but not limited to):

- detecting events from news
- linguistic expression of relevant events
- filtering relevant events
- cumulation of information from news streams
- detecting opinions and perspectives
- finding trending or serendipitous stories in news
- tracing perspective change through time
- modeling plot structures
- storyline stability and completeness
- annotating storylines
- temporal or causal ordering of events
- linguistics resources for storylines
- big data as a source for storylines
- evaluation of storylines
- discourse structure and storylines
- visualisation of storylines
- detecting facts and speculations
- dynamic event modeling

=============
Submissions
=============

This call solicits full papers reporting original and unpublished research on storylines from news. Full papers should emphasize obtained results rather than intended work, and should indicate clearly the state of completion of the reported results. Submission should not exceed a maximum 8 pages plus two additional pages containing references.

Authors are also invited to submit short papers not exceeding 4 pages (plus two additional pages for references). Short papers should describe:
- a small, focused contribution;
- work in progress;
- a negative result;
- a position paper.

The reviewing process will be blind and papers should not include the authors' names and affiliations. Each submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. If you do include any author names on the title page, your submission will be automatically rejected. In the body of your submission, you should eliminate all direct references to your own previous work. Accepted papers will be published in the workshop proceedings and available at the ACL Anthology.

Multiple Submission Policy Papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or publications are acceptable, but authors must indicate this information at submission time. If accepted, authors must notify the organizers as to whether the paper will be presented at the workshop or elsewhere.

Submissions must be in PDF format and formatted following the official ACL 2015 submission styles available at <A HREF="http://acl2015.org/call_for_papers.html">http://acl2015.org/call_for_papers.html</A>

Contributions should be submitted in PDF via the submission site (<A HREF="https://www.softconf.com/acl2015/CNewS/">https://www.softconf.com/acl2015/CNewS/</A>)

============
Shared Data
============

We encourage participants to re-use the SemEval 2015 Task 4: Timelines dataset (<A HREF="http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2015/task4/index.php?id=data-and-tools">http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2015/task4/index.php?id=data-and-tools</A>) to provide their own annotations, interpretations, and system results. The data will be collected before the workshop and summarized to facilitate an insightful comparison.
